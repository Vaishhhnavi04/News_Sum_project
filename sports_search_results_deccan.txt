Pickleball, the racquet sports craze is growing all over India. Not merely as a recreational sport but also as a competitive sport. Pickleballis now being played by kids, adults, and even senior citizens. Pickleball, which is a mix of badminton, tennis, and ping pong, is an easy game for beginners to pick up. It can be played on a badminton-size court (indoor or outdoor) with two or fourplayers. It is played with paddles that are used to hit a plastic perforated ball (to withstand windy conditions). As a contact-free sport, it grew during the pandemic.FITNESS & FUNPrachi Golus, a 21-year-oldMBA student from Hyderabad who began playing pickleball two years ago says, “I was introduced to Pickleball by the college sports faculty as I was a Table Tennis player. Since then, I have consistently engaged in pickleball as itprovides an enjoyable way to stay physically active, especially after studying for long hours I find it relaxing and de-stressing.”PROMOTES SOCIAL ACTIVITYSuneel Michigan, 62-year-old, Director of IT Business from Hyderabad who has been playing Pickleball forthe last one-and-half year now says, “I have never been active in any sports nor have I been to a gym. My uncle who is 75 plus from the USAintroduced me to this sport during his visit to India. Now I enjoy pickleball as it is a low-impact game.”Michigan plays the game 3 to 4 days a week and it has helped him to be more flexible and has increased his stamina. “Being active with pickleball releases feel-good endorphins and reduces the negative effects of stress, so I feel more positive and relaxed. Also, I have made new friends of all age groups now as we meet on the court often,” he says.GAME HISTORYPickleball was created in Bainbridge Island, USA in 1965 by Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum to entertain their children during the summer. As the sport was made as a mix of rules the trio named it Pickleball after the pickle boat, a rowing crew that is thrown together from available rowers. Sunil Valavalkar, a sports enthusiast brought pickleball to India as he enjoyed playing it on his trips abroad and he formed in 2008 the All-India Pickleball Association (AIPA). Today in India it is also growing as a competitive game for experienced, athletic players. There are now pickleball tournaments, leagues, and clubs in India.EXPERT SPEAKArvind Prabhoo the President of the All-India Pickleball Association and the President of the International Pickleball Federation says, “Pickleball is a lifestyle game it is easy to learn and it is also fun as well excellent for fitness that is why being played in various cities. Also, courts are coming up in Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, and Chennai.” AIPAis spreading its wings and is operational in 19 states andintends to go to 10 more states next year. It also plans to start aleague of its own to popularise the game. Earlier the paddles and balls were imported but nowhomegrown companies are making them at a cheap price. So, it is not an expensive affair to play the sport. B Chakrapani, Head Coach of Telangana State says, “While pickleball is easy for beginners to learn, mastering the sport requires skill, strategy, and practice. Like any competitive activity, it takes time and dedication to reach a high level of proficiency. However, the learning curve is manageable, for players of varying abilities to enjoy both recreationally and competitively.” “Pickleball has numerous benefits for young as well as old. It improves cardiovascular health, is a low-impact exercise that enhances hand-eye coordination, and helps maintain mobility and flexibility. Additionally, it fosters social connections and provides an exciting way to stay active,” he adds.FAMOUS PICKLERSBollywood writer-director Shashank Khaitan is also a pickleball enthusiast and Partner of Global Sports. (which promotes Pickleball in India). He says, “I have been active in Tennis, Football, and Cricket. When I played pickleball for the first time I took a liking for the game So I decided to promote and invest in it. Last year I travelled to London and Bali to play some amateur/ pro tournaments. Our team of Global Sports has conducted four of the best and biggest tournaments in India in the last year. We see the game growing in two verticals, one as a lifestyle sport and two as a competitive sport. Men and women of all ages and different skill sets can come together and play this game.” This helps in building bonds along with burning calories. “We want young athletes to play professionally to have a career and are working to create an ecosystem. We also want India to be the hub of Pickleball for the world,” adds Khaitan. He is known for his work in movies Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahaani and Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania.KEEP CALM, GAME ONPickleball, a sport thriving in over 90 countries globally is also now growing in India.

However the loss to USA at the playoffs made us come to fight for   the 7th spot Vs India and we won that by 4 wickets to remain at 7th".

 Hyderabad: A two-judge bench of the Telangana High Court directed the GHMC to consider afresh the complaint of a flat owners association on the functioning of a gaming institution in the vicinity. The bench, comprising Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice N.V. Shravan Kumar, modified the order of a single judge, who had directed the GHMC to take action on complaints of nuisance said to be caused by the appellant, Pulse 7. Earlier, Udaya Northend Apartments Association at Kondapur filed a writ petition complaining that Pulse 7 was carrying out outdoor sports activities without a proper licence and causing nuisance to the residents of the flats. The single judge had required the GHMC to take further steps based upon a show cause notice issued by it. In appeal, Pulse 7 contended that it had valid licences and permission and that the single judge ought not to have issued the directions without hearing the appellant. The bench modified the order and directed the GHMC to afford an opportunity to both parties and pass fresh orders. Vidyuth ombudsman powers limited: HCA two-judge panel of the Telangana High Court held that the Vidyut ombudsman could not decide complaints lodged by persons who are not consumers of electricity and are applicants for power connections. The panel, comprising Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice N.V. Shravan Kumar, accordingly allowed a writ plea filed by the superintending engineer of TS Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) and others requiring it to supply power and fresh connection to a purchaser from a defaulting consumer. Earlier, a single judge had directed the appellants to provide a power connection to Palabatla Sridevi over a land parcel in Mahbubnagar and had upheld the findings of the Vidyut ombudsman that the due was time-barred and that the present consumer Sri Palabatla Sridevi was not in due of any amount. It’s her predecessor in title Sheetal Shipping and Metal Processors Limited that had failed to make payments. She contended that she could not be forced to make payments that were due from the previous consumer. Without going into the said question, the bench allowed the appeal on the ground that the Vidyut ombudsman acted without jurisdiction and accordingly set aside the order. Tribal women seek sand quarrying rightsJustice Nagesh Bheempaka of the Telangana High Court entertained a writ plea filed by a tribal women society engaged in sand quarrying. Sri Rama Tribal Mahila Sand Quarry filed a writ plea questioning the non-grant of quarry licence for mining sand at Bhadrachalam.

The matter now will be heard again alongside the response of the state mining authorities after two weeks. HC pulls up Union government in autism case Justice S.

She directed the Union of India to file its response to a 2014 writ petition by March 11. The judge was dealing with a writ plea filed by Amrutha Ramanujam, an autism consultant and vice-president of the Autism Society of India.
