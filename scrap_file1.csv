FPIs quizzed on 'loans' for trading,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/fpis-quizzed-on-loans-for-trading/articleshow/108336342.cms,"AgenciesSeveral foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been asked by the Indian tax office on whether they have borrowed money to trade on stock exchanges.It’s unclear why the information was sought, but the Income Tax (I-T) department has directed these offshore funds to disclose the identities of the lenders, the latter’s source of money, and the nature of agreement between the two parties.The move to fish out such information could well be to trace any possible and indirect links between overseas portfolio managers with Indian companies and promoters, feel some of the tax and finance professionals.“Interest paid by a non-resident lender to a non-resident borrower can also be taxed in India if the debt is used for a ‘business’ in India. But, this doesn’t happen in the case of FPIs,” said Rajesh Gandhi, partner, Deloitte India. 'No clarity on tax implications'“Perhaps, the other aspect which tax authorities could be trying to examine is whether there is any round-tripping of Indian money into FPIs directly or indirectly through the debt route,” said Gandhi.In fact, while directing FPIs to share details of the capital contributors in the funds, tax officials have enquired about the “source of fund of the entity which contributed the capital or provided loan” and whether any loans were taken by the capital contributors.“Usually we have not seen questions around lending transactions in the context of FPIs because it’s difficult to understand what could be the tax implications of the same. Since an FPI only earns capital gains in India and no business income, one would need to see how the assessments in these cases evolve,” said Keyur Shah, partner and leader financial services, tax and regulatory, EY. The I-T department has the authority to look into the source of a source to trace the money trail, said Bhavesh Gandhi, co-founder of Incorp Advisory Services Pvt Ltd, a tax and consultancy service provider. “But there is no real tax implication unless the fund has claimed the interest outgo on such loans as deduction to pay a lower tax on capital gains,” he said.The current notices, served over the past three weeks, add to a slew of probing queries (reported by ET on February 20) that the I-T department has been raising since early January to figure out whether the FPIs have adequate presence — ‘substance’ in taxman’s parlance — in Mauritius and Singapore or were simply running paper offices to claim tax benefits allowed under the treaties between India and these jurisdictions.For instance, one of the notices asks a fund to provide minutes of board meetings held years ago, for approving the purchase of shares in India, sale of the securities as well as for authorising the opening of a bank account in Mauritius.Under the revised treaties, FPIs from these financial centres do not have to pay tax on capital gains made on sale of shares which were bought before April 2017. Besides, such FPIs even today pay no tax on the money they make on derivatives trading. Thus, technically funds having no ‘substance’ in the treaty countries can be denied the tax exemptions.“However, so far we have not received any order making tax claims on the funds despite the queries. In one case, the department had asked for the first meeting of the board of directors undertaken after incorporation in Mauritius. Now, this was more than a decade ago,” said another person advising some of the funds.In the earlier set of notices, the I-T office had also enquired about the “beneficial owners” of funds and “authorised signatories” — information that is typically compiled by fund custodians and shared with the capital market regulator.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onforeign portfolio investorsFPIstradingloansIndian tax officeIncome Tax departmentDeloitte Indiaoffshore fundsstock exchangeslenders(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News....moreless(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onforeign portfolio investorsFPIstradingloansIndian tax officeIncome Tax departmentDeloitte Indiaoffshore fundsstock exchangeslenders(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News....morelessPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionKa-Ching: Global drug makers ride luck in pursuit of blockbuster drugs, vaccinesRenewing Ola vs. Uber: How Dara Khosrowshahi reignited Bhavish Aggarwal’s OG cab-hailing duelWarren Buffett has USD169 billion in cash.

"As RBI acts tough, NBFCs fear banks may turn wary of lending",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/as-rbi-acts-tough-nbfcs-fear-banks-may-turn-wary-of-lending/articleshow/108309153.cms,"IANSMumbai, March 4 (IANS) The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Monday directed IIFL Finance Ltd. to stop sanctioning or disbursing gold loans or assigning/securitising/selling any of its gold loans with immediate effect.Finance companies would moderate loan disbursals as they look to boost internal control systems after the banking regulator recently ordered curbs on two high-margin - but potentially risky - business lines: Gold loans and securities financing. Such restrictions would make banks conservative while lending to non-bank financiers, which would leave the latter with insufficient liquidity for onward lending.""Banks also believe that other finance companies may receive a similar diktat from the banking regulator, while some NBFCs are concerned that banks may not be very forthcoming in lending to them,"" said a senior bank official.In such a scenario, a non-bank lender will slow down lending, maintain a liquidity buffer, and conserve capital, said a senior economist with a rating company.This week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) banned IIFL Finance from giving gold loans; JM Financial Products has not been allowed to undertake financing of bonds and stock. Last month, the regulator barred Paytm Payments Bank from accepting deposits or top-ups, restricting it from conducting normal banking operations. Equity broking firms also believe the RBI's moves will have temporary implications for credit expansion, although the benefits in the long run will outweigh short-term pains. ""We believe these punitive actions will impact systemic growth for NBFCs in the near term, but will hopefully curb unethical business practices, avert systemic collapse as seen in the past,"" stock broking firm Emkay Global said.""We believe that the list of financial penalties, and even of business embargos, is likely to scale up and should thus keep regulated entities and fintechs on edge,"" it added.The sharp rise in bank lending to NBFC is also worrying regulators, which may get tempered with such regulatory action. ""Bank funding to the NBFC sector has risen so sharply in the last five years that there is a genuine concern over the end use of funds and the impact it could have on the system,"" said Sanjay Agarwal, senior director at CareEdge Ratings.Data compiled by CareEdge Ratings show that banks' lending to finance companies rose 3.8x from 5% in March 2017 to 9.6% in October 2023. The exposure rose from ₹3.8 lakh crore to ₹14.8 lakh crore during the same period. The top management of finance companies has directed its field staff to revisit the processes and ensure that they comply with the regulations, said a senior official of finance companies who did not want to be named.In case of IIFL Finance, Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa-backed Fairfax promptly announced that it would provide a $200 million liquidity support to the company if it faces any funding crunch due to regulator's action.

"NARCL emerges winning bidder for Rs 17,000 cr debt",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/narcl-emerges-winning-bidder-for-rs-17000-cr-debt/articleshow/108309132.cms,"Getty ImagesRepresentative imageGovernment-backed National Asset Reconstruction Company of India (NARCL) emerged as the winning bidder for six distressed accounts with outstanding debt of more than ₹17,000 crore that banks have put on the block in the last three months, said people with knowledge of the matter.The six accounts are Metenere, Pink City Expressway, West Haryana Highways Projects, Entertainment City, SEW LSY Highways and Simplex Infrastructures. NARCL has offered ₹2,331 crore for the loans totalling ₹17,139 crore, according to the people.Seven other accounts have binding offers from NARCL. A Swiss auction process, with NARCL's offers as the base, is held separately for each of these companies and the due diligence by potential bidders is still ongoing. ET BureauThese are Metalyst Forgings, Rohtak Hisar Tollways, Wind World India, Hitodi Infrastructure, Morarjee Textiles, Sion Panvel Tollways and West Haryana Highways Projects.All the offers made by NARCL are under the 15:85 structure, of which 15% of consideration is in cash and the balance 85% is security receipts, which will be payable on recovery of the loan or in five years, whichever is earlier. The government has provided a sovereign guarantee on the shortfall in the recovery of loans promised by NARCL, which gives the government-backed company a competitive edge over other ARCs.NARCL has been actively acquiring distressed loans since Diwakar Gupta took charge as chairman in the first week of December 2023. Before this, Gupta was chairman of India Debt Resolution Company, an agent for NARCL. He replaced Karnam Sekar, who resigned last August soon after IDRCL proposed to the finance ministry to merge NARCL with IDRCL, which did not materialise.Since it started operations in January 2022, NARCL has completed acquisition of six accounts: Jaypee Infratech, SSA International, Helios Photovoltaic, Dharani Sugars, SMPL Infra and Parenteral Drugs. It also acquired Srei Infrastructure Finance and Srei Equipment Finance under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.Meanwhile, FY25 that starts next month will be a challenging one for IDRCL which is tasked with the mandate to resolve the distressed loans acquired by NARCL, said people from the ARC industry. The challenge would be to recover the money without invoking the sovereign guarantee, they added.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onasset reconstructionNARCLdebtdistressed accountsoutstanding debtmetalyst forgingssimplex infrastructuresparenteral drugsmorarjee textiles(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News....moreless(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onasset reconstructionNARCLdebtdistressed accountsoutstanding debtmetalyst forgingssimplex infrastructuresparenteral drugsmorarjee textiles(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News....morelessPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionKa-Ching: Global drug makers ride luck in pursuit of blockbuster drugs, vaccinesRenewing Ola vs. Uber: How Dara Khosrowshahi reignited Bhavish Aggarwal’s OG cab-hailing duelWarren Buffett has USD169 billion in cash.

Banks asked to list stalled housing projects,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banks-asked-to-list-stalled-housing-projects/articleshow/108308540.cms,"iStockLooking to push for faster resolution and completion of stressed housing projects, the government has asked banks to compile and share a list of stalled legacy projects under the SWAMIH fund.After discussions with all stakeholders, it was pointed out that procedural delays were the primary reason behind the lower exposure of public sector bank (PSB) projects under the Special Window for Completion of Construction of Affordable and Mid-Income Housing Projects, or SWAMIH, fund, said two people familiar with the matter. ""There are significant shortcomings in the unilateral approach through existing regulatory mechanisms to find resolution for such projects,"" said an official, adding that the government received feedback that although the SWAMIH fund has been successful over the years, scaling up is an issue, considering the large number of stalled projects. Lenders will also share their feasibility reports with the fund, which provides finance for the completion of stressed projects, the above quoted official said. As per latest data, SWAMIH-I has returned over 25% of drawn capital to its investors and completed over 26,000 apartments.This follows an amendment by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India in regulations barring liquidators from sale of housing units already allotted and in possession as part of the liquidation process. ""Another suggestion was that information on the progress of the SWAMIH fund may also be shared with all the concerned stakeholders,"" said another executive aware of the deliberations held over the last two months.Earlier, the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) estimated that 412,000 stressed dwelling units involving ₹4.08 lakh crore are impacted by stalled real estate projects. About 240,000 stressed dwelling units are in the national capital region, according to a report by a committee headed by former NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant.Separately, banks have reached out to the RBI to seek exemption for the SWAMIH fund from the December 2023 guidelines that restrict investments of regulated entities in alternate investment funds (AIF), which directly or indirectly invest in companies where the investing regulated entity has either lent or invested.""We have sought exemption on the grounds that SWAMIH fund has been sponsored by the government,"" said a senior bank executive, adding that the fund has regulated entities as its investors and that there can be challenges to the fund's continuity and operations if such an exemption is not given.

Bombay HC grants bail to former IL&FSâ€™s vice chairman Hari Sankaran,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-former-ilfss-vice-chairman-hari-sankaran/articleshow/108303983.cms,"The Bombay High Court on Thursday granted bail to former Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) vice-chairman Hari Sankaran. Justice Prithviraj K Chavan, while granting bail ruled that Sankaran shall attend the trial court ‘scrupulously unless exempted’ and has also directed him to surrender his passport before the trial court within a week from the date of passing of this order. “The applicant (Sankaran) shall not tamper with the evidence or attempt to influence or contact any of the witnesses or persons concerned with this case,” said the court in its order. “In case of breach of any of the aforesaid conditions, the prosecution shall be at liberty to seek cancellation of bail,” it further added. However, soon after the court granted bail, counsel appearing for the Special Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) sought a stay to the order for one week so that the investigation agency could approach the Supreme Court to challenge this order. While countering this, Senior Counsel Aabad Ponda appeared for the Sankaran and argued that the applicant had been incarcerated for nearly five years and hence it would be unjustifiable to stay the order. Before the bail was granted, Special Public Prosecutor HS Venegavkar, appearing for the SFIO had objected to the granting of bail and urged to reject the application by contending that the accused has no exclusive right to seek his release on bail. In 2018, IL&FS accumulated a debt of over Rs. 91,000 crore and defaulted on some of its commitments. Subsequently, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal allowed the replacement of the earlier board of IL&FS with a new one led by Uday Kotak, MD of Kotak Mahindra Bank. Also, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and several investigation agencies had also initiated a probe into the financials of the group.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onIL&FSHari Sankaranbailtrial courtBombay High CourtSpecial Fraud Investigation OfficeInfrastructure Leasing & Financial ServicesSupreme CourtNational Company Law Tribunal(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News....moreless(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onIL&FSHari Sankaranbailtrial courtBombay High CourtSpecial Fraud Investigation OfficeInfrastructure Leasing & Financial ServicesSupreme CourtNational Company Law Tribunal(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News....morelessPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionKa-Ching: Global drug makers ride luck in pursuit of blockbuster drugs, vaccinesRenewing Ola vs. Uber: How Dara Khosrowshahi reignited Bhavish Aggarwal’s OG cab-hailing duelWarren Buffett has USD169 billion in cash.

Speaking to ET Now, Governor Das clarified, ""RBI is and remains fully supportive of Fintech... RBI is all for Fintech to grow.""Das underscored the RBI's favor towards innovation within the financial technology sector, highlighting the introduction of Sandbox for testing new tools. He used a simple analogy, likening the situation to owning and driving a Ferrari while still adhering to traffic rules to prevent accidents. He said that one may own and drive a Ferrari but still one has to obey the traffic rules to avoid accidents. Regarding the deadline for linking wallets attached to PPBL with other banks, Governor Das stated that March 15 remains the fixed deadline, with no plans for further extension. He expressed confidence in the sufficiency of the given time frame, noting that 80-85 per cent of Paytm wallets are already linked to other banks, with the remaining 15 per cent advised to make the transition promptly.When questioned about the timeline for NPCI's decision on the Paytm payment app license, Das clarified that it is subject to internal due diligence. ""So far, as RBI is concerned, we have informed them that we have no objection if NPCI considers the Paytm payment app to continue because our action was against the Paytm Payment Bank. The app is with the NPCI... NPCI will take a call... I think they should be taking a call shortly,"" he stated.  RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das reassured that 80-85% of Paytm wallet users won't be affected by regulatory measures, with the remaining advised to link their accounts to other banks. The Reserve Bank of India prohibited Paytm Payments Bank (PPBL) from certain transactions since January 31. Das affirmed the March 15 deadline for wallet linkage, dismissing further extensions, emphasizing ample time and support for compliance. He clarified that RBI's actions targeted PPBL, not the entire Fintech sector, advocating innovation and introducing Sandbox for experimentation.

Mahindra Finance aims to nearly double non-vehicle loan book in FY25,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/mahindra-finance-aims-to-nearly-double-non-vehicle-loan-book-in-fy25/articleshow/108264413.cms,"AgenciesIndia's non-bank lender Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services will adopt a de-risking strategy and aims to nearly double its non-vehicle loans portfolio in the next financial year, its vice chairman and managing director said on Wednesday. ""Our aim is 20% of the balance sheet should comprise of non-vehicle business,"" Ramesh Iyer told Reuters, adding its focus will be on financing small and medium enterprises (SME) that include business loans, machinery, and loans against property. Currently, non-vehicle finance comprises 5%-6% of the company's loan book. The target will be met in phases and may not exceed 10% in 2024-25, Iyer said. Mahindra Finance is one of India's largest deposit-taking non-banking financial companies, offering vehicle loans, SME finance, personal loans, and housing finance, among others. Within vehicle loans, Iyer expects pre-owned vehicle segments to drive growth on the back of high demand and attractive yields. The company plans to grow its assets under management by 25% on-year to 1.25 trillion rupees in the next financial year, Iyer said. The non-bank lender expects net interest margins to be at around 7% by March-end from 6.8% in the fiscal third quarter, and then inch up to 7.2% by the end of the next financial year, assuming the Reserve Bank of India starts cutting its key lending rate. Mahindra Finance will also look to tap the overseas market for funding for the first time in the next financial year starting in April, through either loans or bonds, Iyer said. ""It will depend on what is the landed cost of money. We will look at the liquidity situation in India, the all-inclusive cost of fund and the period for which such funds are available."" The company is also looking to add two more banks as partners for co-lending and will open 125 new branches in the next financial year.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onM&M FinanceMahindra Financesmall and medium enterprisesloans against propertyramesh iyer(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News....moreless(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onM&M FinanceMahindra Financesmall and medium enterprisesloans against propertyramesh iyer(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News....morelessPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionHDFC Bank’s Shashidhar Jagdishan is focused on profitable growth.

The central bank had asked IIFL Finance to 'cease and desist' from sanctioning, disbursing and selling gold loans with immediate effect, citing ""material supervisory concerns"" in its gold loan portfolio. Since then, the company has seen its share price lose around 36 per cent. As of 12:30 on Wednesday, the shares of IIFL Finance were trading with cuts of 20 per cent. ""We are committed to complying fully with RBI's directives and growing the business under the regulator's guidance,"" said Nirmal Jain, managing director and founder of IIFL Finance.RBI said the concerns it spotted in the gold loan portfolio were raised with the company and that it has been taking corrective measures. However, in an analyst call, IIFL Finance said that RBI’s actions ‘came as a surprise and was quicker than expected.’IIFL Finance's gold loans under management stood at Rs 24,692 crore as of December 31. They account for around 32 per cent of total loan assets.A prolonged restriction could impact earnings, lower co-lending income, and there could potentially be higher cost of finances, brokerage Jefferies said in a note. It estimates the company’s EPS to fall over 25-30 per cent should the ban stay for nine months.RBI will review the restrictions on IIFL Finance after completion of a special audit and rectifications by the company.

"RBI bars JM Financial Products from share and bond funding due to regulatory lapses, company has refuted regulators claims",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/rbi-bars-jm-financial-products-from-share-and-bond-funding-due-to-regulatory-lapses-company-has-refuted-regulators-claims/articleshow/108245016.cms,"ANIRBI bars JM Financial Products from lending against shares, bondsMUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) barred JM Financial Products Ltd from undertaking any form of business in shares and bonds funding due to regulatory violations and governance lapses, said a strongly worded letter issued by the banking regulator on Tuesday. The RBI statement directed JM Financial Products to “cease and desist, with immediate effect, from doing any form of financing against shares and debentures, including sanction and disbursal of loans against Initial Public Offering (IPO) of shares as well as against subscription to debentures.” JM Financial have strongly denied claims of lapses and violation made by the regulator. The RBI said the company can continue to finance its existing loan accounts through collection and recovery.JM Financial Products is a systemically important non-banking finance company registered with RBI and 99.71% is owned by stock exchange listed JM Financial Ltd. It is focused on capital market, bespoke, and real estate financing.RBI said this action is necessitated due to certain serious deficiencies observed in loans sanctioned for IPO financing and as non-convertible debentures subscriptions.A statement issued by JM Financial said, There have been no material deficiencies in our loan sanctioning process. The company has not violated applicable regulations…. there have been no governance issues whatsoever.”The company has a loan book of Rs 4600 crore and assets under management of Rs 7197 crore at the end of the third quarter for FY24, according to the stock exchange disclosures.While conducting the limited review, the RBI observed that “the company repeatedly helped a group of its customers to bid for various IPO and NCD offerings by using loaned funds. The credit underwriting was found to be perfunctory, and financing was done against meagre margins.”The banking regulator’s order also noted that the “application for subscription, the demat accounts and the bank accounts, all were operated by the company using a Power of Attorney (POA) and a Master Agreement obtained from these customers without their involvement, whatsoever, in the subsequent operations.”The RBI pointed out that due to this arrangement, “the company was able to effectively act as both lender as well as borrower. The company also acted as the arranger of bank account opening as well as operator of the said bank accounts using the POA.”In response to this, JM Financial stated, “We have been in the business of funding IPOs over the last two decades. The IPO financing product is short term and self-liquidating in nature. In the context of IPO funding, the POA is taken as a risk containment measure only. The practice of taking POA is prevalent across the industry and is perfectly legal.”The banking regulator stated that these are regulatory violations and raises serious concerns about governance issues, which are detrimental to customers' interest. The RBI will review business restrictions on the completion of a special audit to be instituted by the RBI and after rectification of deficiencies to the satisfaction of the RBI.JM Financial also stated, “All our business and operational affairs in a bonafide manner. The company shall continue to service its existing customers as advised by the RBI.”(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onjm financialrbijm financial productsnbfcgovernance lapsesipo(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News....moreless(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onjm financialrbijm financial productsnbfcgovernance lapsesipo(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News....morelessPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionKa-Ching: Global drug makers ride luck in pursuit of blockbuster drugs, vaccinesRenewing Ola vs. Uber: How Dara Khosrowshahi reignited Bhavish Aggarwal’s OG cab-hailing duelWarren Buffett has USD169 billion in cash.
