RCB end 16-year wait for title; beat DC by 8 wickets to grab WPL,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/sports/cricket/rcb-end-16-year-wait-for-title-beat-dc-by-8-wickets-to-grab-wpl-title-885595,17 March 2024 7:52 PM GMT,"New Delhi: A spirited women's team washed away Royal Challengers Bangalore's 16 years of hurt and disappointment, landing their maiden title which came through an eight-wicket win over Delhi Capitals in front of a cheering full house in the Women's Premier League final here on Sunday.Once the spin pair of Shreyanka Patil (4/12) and Sophie Molineux (3/20) engineered a DC collapse to 113 all out, there could have been only one winner.But the formalities had to be completed. RCB did it via their talismanic skipper Smriti Mandhana (31), Sophie Devine (32) and the impactful Elysse Perry (35 not out).The Royal Challengers made 115 for two in 19.3 overs, a far easier victory than that tight-looking final over finish.There will be celebrations in the dressing room, at a packed Arun Jaitley Stadium where a near full house bayed for a RCB win and in thousands of living rooms miles away in Bangalore.A generation of RCB fans have waited for this moment, a wait that often gave fodder to social media trolls and memes.All they could show during these years were three final appearances in 2009, 2011 and 2016.But all that changed tonight. They have a trophy in their cabinet now.But DC, led by Meg Lanning, will rue the missed chance of bettering their runners-up position from WPL 2023, whereas RCB improved their fourth-place finish last year in a brilliant fashion.Chasing a modest target, RCB started cautiously with the pair of Mandhana and Devine sharing 49 runs in 8.1 overs.While Mandhana played the role of an anchor, Devine opted to attack, decorating her innings with five boundaries and one maximum before she was trapped in front by pacer Shikha Pandey.The wicket seemed to have slowed down RCB as Mandhana and Perry  struggled to find their timing as boundaries dried up.Perry finally broke the shackles in the 13th over, hitting pacer Arundhati Reddy to the deep midwicket boundary and then two balls later Mandhana cut the bowler to backward point fence.RCB were nearly at home, reaching 82 for one in the 15th over but a rash shot from Mandhana led to her downfall.The left-hander skied a Minnu Mani delivery to Reddy at mid-on to keep the contest alive.But Perry continued her fine run and in the company of Richa Ghosh (17 not out) calmly helped RCB reach 115 in 19.3 overs, sharing an unbeaten 33 runs for the third wicket.Ghosh finished off the chase in style with a four off Reddy.But the RCB spinners too can claim rightful credit for this triumph.DC were cruising at 64 for no loss in 43 balls before they committed harakiri, losing 10 wickets for just 49 runs in front of a 28,781 capacity crowd, who looked divided in their loyalties.Molineux started DC's downfall, picking up three wickets in the eighth over.Thereafter, the hosts never really recovered, losing wickets at regular intervals, courtesy some loose shots and off-spinner Shreyanka's exploits in the middle and late overs.It came after Lanning (23 off 23) and Shafali Verma (44 off 27) looked in a different world as they upped the tempo in a linear fashion.Lanning played the second fiddle as Shafali went hammer and tongs after a slow start in the first 11 balls.Shafali was particularly destructive straight down the ground as she slammed her first three sixes in that region.She opened up her arms in the final delivery of the second over when she went down on her knee to dispatch Molineux over long-on for the first six of the innings.The right-arm pacer Renuka Singh was taken to task in the fourth over, which yielded 19 runs.Shafali started the onslaught clobbering the bowler over her head for a six, which eventually inspired Lanning.She struck two boundaries off the last two deliveries of the same over to match her partner as DC reached 52 in five overs.But RCB managed to put brakes on DC when Molineux scalped three wickets in the eighth over, dismissing Shafali, Jemmimah Rodrigues and Alice Capsey.After reaching 72 for 3 at the halfway mark, DC's mainstay Lanning, who was trying to resurrect the innings, departed, getting trapped leg before by Shreyanka.Thereafter, the home team kept losing wickets in search of unnecessary big shots to stumble to 81 for six.It was mayhem for DC as they lost seven wickets for mere 23 runs in that period and the recovery never came forth.The fans who filled the Jaitley stadium to the rafters also made this festival-like occasion, constantly rooting for their favourite teams and dancing to the tunes of drums and music.But in the end, the red and gold brigade from the far South brought up a popular win.

The ‘Rajya Khel Alankaran Samaroh- 2024’ was held here after a gap of five years where chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai honoured 544 sportspersons from Chhattisgarh who have excelled in various sports at the state, national and international levels.   The annual sports award giving function, introduced during the Raman Singh government in 2007 in honour of security personnel martyred in the counter insurgency operations in Bastar in Chhattisgarh, was stopped when Congress came to power in the state in 2018.   The decision by the previous Congress government to discontinue the function had triggered widespread resentment among youths in the state who had taken to streets demanding its revival.   The sportspersons from Chhattisgarh who excel at the national and international level are being honoured under different categories of awards, named after police officers martyred in the anti-Naxal operations Bastar, at the function.   Those honoured with the Martyr Rajiv Pandey award are declared eligible for sports quota in government jobs.   “As many as 74 sportspersons have so far been absorbed in government jobs. The remaining sportspersons found eligible for sports quota will soon be given government jobs”, state sports and youth welfare minister Tank Ram Verma said.   Addressing the function, Mr Sai expressed regret over the absence of such ceremonies under the previous government’s tenure.   “The discontinuance of such an important function during the previous Congress government had triggered disappointment among the youths in the state”, he said.   Sources said that BJP is set to showcase the revival of the event in the upcoming LS elections to woo the young voters to support the party in the polls.   There are around 18 lakh voters aged 18-22 years in Chhattisgarh.   “The youths had hit the streets in protest against the discontinuance of the function during the previous Congress government in the state. The Vishnu Deo Sai government has reinstated the event following demand by the youths”, former chief minister Dr Raman Singh who is now speaker of Chhattisgarh Assembly said, while addressing the function.
