Anyway, cricket is a game of uncertainty and I   felt we were a very competitive team and other teams too had their hands   up to say Sri Lanka were a team to watch out, perhaps our batting let   us down over all". "I   thought our team was a team worthy of the semi finals spot, after which   we also had an opportunity at getting the Plate Trophy by coming in at   5th. However the loss to USA at the playoffs made us come to fight for   the 7th spot Vs India and we won that by 4 wickets to remain at 7th". "Hats   off to all our players, I'm sure it was an experience of its own, I   know we were a better team going into the tournament, but unfortunately   cricket is a funny game", he further added.
