ReutersRepresentative imageA consortium of German Formula 1 racetrack designer Tilke, real estate consultancy company CBRE and architecture firm Arcop ranked the highest on a list of six international consultants that are competing for designing a racetrack in Gujarat's GIFT City that could position the financial centre also as an international sporting destination, according to people in the know.The Tilke-led consortium scored 98% marks in an evaluation conducted by Sports Authority of Gujarat during March 7-8 and is likely to be granted the work order to develop a design for the F1 track, the people said.The project could cost up to ₹10,000 crore.The other groups of international consultants that competed for the project included globally renowned F1 racetrack designers.ET BureauBritish designer Clive Bowen's consortium with KPMG came in second with a score of 91%. The other bidders included a consortium led by Ahetesham Khan of Nangia Andersen with Italian track designer Jarno Zaffelli and Isha Rathee-led Populous Design that bid solo. International architecture firms Collage Design and Cox Architects and DAR Consultants were also among the bidders.Tilke did not respond to ET's queries. CBRE and Arcop declined to comment. The other bidders also did not comment. Sports Authority of Gujarat director general RS Ninama did not respond to emailed queries till press time on Sunday.The winning bidder will have to present a plan to the sports authority by August 31 (this year) on the feasibility and potential design of a racetrack.GIFT City, located in Gandhinagar, has been developed as a financial centre to attract international companies to set up shop. The government expects multiple businesses to be drawn to the city because of the tax breaks it is offering them.There is a major focus on developing entertainment and leisure infrastructure to make the city liveable. For instance, projects are under way to build an underwater aquarium, water sport facilities and a retail zone with a 158-meter-high ferris wheel.The addition of a F1 racetrack could relaunch India as a motor sport destination after a failed attempt in the last decade. The Buddh International Circuit launched in Noida in 2011 hosted only one F1 race after which its owners, the Jaypee group, went into financial trouble."Formula 1 coming back will be a major boost for motor sport in India," said Narain Karthikeyan, the first Indian driver to compete in the F1 championship.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onF1 racetrack designersGIFT City F1 trackGerman Formula 1 racetrack designer Tilkearchitecture firm ArcopSports Authority of GujaratTilke(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: Is it skiing? Is it horse riding? No, it’s skijoring
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/is-it-skiing-is-it-horse-riding-no-its-skijoring/articleshow/108356428.cms

APA skijoring team competes in Leadville, ColoNick Burri clicks into his ski bindings, squats to stretch his knees and scans the snowy race course. Moments later, he's zipping past a series of gates at high speed and hurtling off jumps. But it's not gravity pulling him toward the finish line: It's the brute force of a quarter horse named Sirius. Welcome to skijoring: an extreme - and quirky - winter sport that celebrates the unlikely melding of rodeo and ski culture in the U.S. Mountain West.  It's a heart-pumping, white-knuckle competition in which horses - and sometimes dogs, snowmobiles and even cars - tow skiers by rope at speeds that can top 40 mph (64 kph) over jumps as high as 8 feet (2.4 meters) and around obstacles as they try to lance suspended hoops with a baton, typically a ski pole that's cut in half. Every winter, thousands of people converge on the old mining town of Leadville, Colorado, high in the Rocky Mountains - elevation 10,158 feet (3,096 meters) - lining downtown's main street and packing the saloons to witness one of the most popular skijoring races in the country. The spectacle, billed as "The Granddaddy of 'em All," has been a tradition here since 1949. "It's just the pure adrenaline that gets me to do it. ... And then getting these two different groups of people together with the riders and the skiers. Usually they don't hang out, and getting them together, we mesh pretty well," said Burri, who wears fringed leather pants with his ski gear in a nod to the sport's Western vibe. Skijoring draws its name from the Norwegian word skikjoring, meaning "ski driving." It started as a practical mode of transportation in Scandinavia and became popular in the Alps around 1900.  Today's sport is inherently dangerous, and injuries are not uncommon among riders and skiers alike. Indeed, one of the first riders in the Leadville race earlier this month toppled off his horse and had to be helped off the track as he shook his head in confusion. Burri did well in the competition despite skiing with a separated shoulder from a hard spill during a race two weeks earlier.  "Wrong turn, taking a jump wrong, go down wrong. You could end your season. Then hospital bills rack up, but it's just for the thrill of it," said Burri, a 26-year-old from Meeker, Colorado. Another skier, Jason Decker, pulled out of the race at the last minute because he broke his collarbone in a crash during a recent contest. He sometimes wears a protective cup, a valuable lesson learned after being hit in the groin by a flying chunk of snow flung by a horse's hoof.  "It's not uncommon that my hands are shaking a little bit even after all this time, because that horse's nostrils are flaring and I'm about ready to grab a rope that's attached to that saddle. And if I'm not ready to go, then things can go bad real quickly," said Decker, a 43-year-old engineer from Pagosa Springs, Colorado, who has been skiing since he was 2 and skijoring for 14 years. Savannah McCarthy, a competitive skijorer since she was 12, describes a similar nervous energy before she mounts her horse for a race. But once she is speeding down the course, her world goes silent. "I don't hear a thing when I'm running," she said. "When it's happening, you really don't have time to think about anything. But when you get done, you're like, 'Holy cow, that was insane,'" said McCarthy, a 24-year-old financial broker from Durango, Colorado, who has won the Leadville race nine times. One of her more memorable moments was when her horse slipped, pulled back and head-butted her, breaking her nose. Then there was the time she lost control of her horse following a race and smashed into a minivan.  Both riders and skiers say those moments - the crashes, the speed, the raucous crowd and the camaraderie - make skijoring what it is. And the sport is growing. Loren Zhimanskova, chair of Skijor USA, which promotes the sport and helps organize races across the country, said skijoring is becoming more mainstream with the rise of social media, and she hopes it will one day be featured in the Winter Olympics. Skijoring is particularly popular in Poland and Switzerland, as well as in Colorado, Wyoming and Montana in the U.S.  Five years ago, about 350 riders and the same amount of skiers were competing in the U.S., she said. Now, there are more than 1,000 competitors in each of those categories, and the number of races has increased from about 15 a year to more than 30. One event in Shakopee, Minnesota, consistently draws a crowd of 10,000 spectators. Despite its growing popularity, getting the sport into the Olympics has proved challenging. There is no official governing body, no uniform set of rules and regulations and no point system that would allow riders to advance to the Winter Games. Plus, every track is different, and every race has its own unique traditions and sometimes stubborn organizers. Still, Zhimanskova is pushing to include skijoring as a non-competitive demonstration sport or to be included in the torch relay at the 2034 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. "I think it's one of the most romantic and visually pleasing sports that you could see. It's just magnificent," she said. "Everyone loves snow ... and then you add horses to that. And then you add cowboys and cowgirls to that. And then you add skiing to that and bonfires and fun music. I mean, all the elements that go into a skijoring event, in my opinion, are really feel-good elements."(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onskijoringwinter sportextreme sportLeadvilleSkijor USAcoloradomccarthyski culture(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: GIFT City gets in pole position for F1 track
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/gift-city-gets-in-pole-position-for-f1-track/articleshow/108309019.cms

AgenciesNew Delhi: GIFT City's plans to become an international sporting destination are moving forward with steps being initiated towards furthering the process for developing a Formula 1 (F1) motor racing circuit in the international finance centre (IFC). The city also has aspirations to host the Olympics in 2036, for which India has thrown its hat in the ring.Six teams of renowned global race track designers and architects arrived in Gandhinagar in Gujarat, where GIFT City is located, on Thursday. They will present their credentials to prepare a master plan for a racing circuit, according to sources aware of the developments.The project, which is expected to relaunch India as a global motor racing destination, could cost as much as Rs 10,000 crore, according to sources.The presenters include the who's who of Formula 1 race track designers such as Germany's Hermann Tilke, a former F1 racer credited with designing the Buddh International Circuit and Las Vegas circuit; Italy's Jarno Zaffelli, who is credited with designing the Zandvoort F1 circuit in the Netherlands and redesigning the Singapore circuit; and Britain's Clive Bowen, who has designed the Silverstone circuit in the UK. The designers will be providing competing ideas on how to build a track that fits into the culture, topography, location and site.Senior functionaries from the Sports Authority of Gujarat will evaluate the presenters.The teams also include world renowned architecture firms and financial consultants such as KPMG, PwC and Nangia Anderson. Former Indian F1 racer Karun Chandhok is also believed to be advising one of the bidding teams.Emailed queries to Hermann Tilke, Clive Bowen, architecture firms and financial consultants did not elicit a response till press time. Sports Authority of Gujarat did not respond to ET's queries."Motorsport circuits can be catalysts for economic impact and raise the awareness of areas/cities or countries. The GIFT area, we understand, with its proximity to Ahmedabad, near the airport and with the right interpretation could make it a destination city and differentiate it on the global stage," said Jarno Zaffelli.Zaffelli did not disclose if he was participating in the bidding process but said he would be in Ahmedabad till March 8."This is likely to be more of a street circuit like the one in Singapore. Not just a purpose-built facility but one that can be available 365 days. GIFT as an epicentre has its own advantages," said Narain Karthikeyan, a former F1 racer and the first Indian to ever drive in the prestigious championship.Motorsport enthusiasts and experts ET spoke with were unanimous in their view that India cannot be ignored any longer by Formula 1 despite a failed attempt in the last decade to make the country part of the annual racing calendar of the prestigious event. Buddh International circuit in Noida, which was launched with much fanfare in 2011, only hosted one F1 race after which its sponsors, the Jaypee group, ran into financial trouble.Singapore’s race track, which is built in the Marina Bay area, extends through the city. On the weekends, when the races are hosted, the streets get converted into a track after putting in place the necessary infrastructure.Global viewership of Formula 1 has only increased over the past decade and the volumes of spectators at races have also grown. There are two dozen races held in a year in 22 countries.“Audiences are growing, especially in the US, which now hosts three races in the year. If you want to make a place a globally recognised sports destination then having a F1 race is not a bad idea,” said Karthikeyan.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onGIFT CityF1 trackinternational sporting destinationFormula 1motor racing circuitOlympicsinternational finance centreGujarat(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: Sports ministry revokes PCI's suspension with immediate effect
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/sports-ministry-revokes-pcis-suspension-with-immediate-effect/articleshow/108243488.cms

ANISports Ministry revokes suspension of Paralympic Committee of IndiaThe Sports Ministry on Tuesday revoked the suspension imposed on the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) after the body initiated the process for its long-pending elections in which multiple-time Paralympic medallist Devendra Jhajharia is set to be elected President. On February 2, the ministry terminated PCI's recognition for "intentional delay to elect a new executive committee" as per the National Sports Code.  The PCI had postponed the elections, which should have been held before January 31 this year, to March 28 because of the impending Para Shooting World Cup from March 6-15.  After its suspension, the body proposed March 9 as the new date to elect governing body members and began the process of nominations. Most of its top posts are set to be filled without any contest.  The ministry said that the "main ground for suspension of government recognition" has been addressed.  "...since the election process has reached the stage where the nominated candidates have been deemed to be duly elected unanimously, as well as the important fact that PCI is hosting 2024 World Shooting Para Sport World Cup from 06-15 March, 2024 at New Delhi, it has been decided to revoke the suspension of PCI, with immediate effect," read a ministry letter to PCI.  "The Returning Officer for election of PCI has vide notification dated 04.03.2024, notified the list of unopposed candidates deemed to be duly elected, in terms of Article 9 sub clause (1) of Model Election Guidelines (Annexure-XXXVII of the Sports Code 2011),"it added.  The Para Shooting World Cup offers 24 Paris Paralympic quota places, and more than 500 shooters from 52 countries will be seen in action in the event to be held at Delhi's Karni Singh Range.  The 42-year-old Jhajharia, who had won a gold medal each in the 2004 Athens and 2016 Rio Paralympics in the F46 disability category, was the only candidate who filed nomination papers for the PCI chief's post.  Returning officer Umesh Sinha issued a list of candidates who had filed nomination papers for various posts, and Jhajharia was the lone name for the president's post.  There will be no contest for all the major posts and voting may only be held for the five slots in the executive committee for which eight candidates have filed their nomination papers.  Jhajharia also won a silver medal in the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021. He clinched a world championships gold in 2013 and a silver in 2015 (both F46 category) as well as a silver in the Asian Para Games in 2014.  Outgoing president Deepa Malik was eligible to contest for the top post but she decided to back Jhajharia's candidature.  Jayawant Hammanawar, an international coach and referee from Goa, is the lone candidate for secretary general's post.  R Chandrashekhar and Satya Prakash Sangwan are set to be elected unopposed as the two vice-presidents, while Sunil Pradhan was the lone candidate for the treasurer's post. Lalit Thakur and T Diwakara are set to be the two joint secretaries.  The eight candidates who are in the fray for the five executive committee members are: Sutapa Chakrabarty, Bhati Chandulal Tarachandji, Sandeep Kumar, Usha Manaki, Amrik Singh, Chandan Roy Choudhary, Shaminder Singh Dhillon and Singarapu Babu.  The PCI had found support from the International Paralympic Committee after the suspension. The IPC had said that it would continue to recognise the PCI as the only body for para sports in India.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onParalympic Committee of IndiaSports MinistrysuspensionelectionsDevendra JhajhariaPresidentNational Sports CodePara Shooting World Cup(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: "Jurel has all credentials to get where MS Dhoni reached....": Anil Kumble

AgenciesDhruv Jurel and MS DhoniNew Delhi: Legendary Indian spinner Anil Kumble said that young wicketkeeper-batter Dhruv Jurel has all the credentials to reach the heights that legendary skipper and wicketkeeper MS Dhoni achieved in his career.Jurel made his Test debut during the third Test at Rajkot, scoring a valuable 46 in 104 balls. India won that match by 434 runs. During the fourth Test in Ranchi as well, the 23-year-old keeper delivered a match-winning performance as well. Speaking to JioCinema, Kumble said that Jurel showed temperament in his technique while defending and attacking both. "Dhruv Jurel certainly has all the credentials to get to where MS (Dhoni) reached in his career. He's not just shown the temperament of his technique to defence but even when he's attacking. Even in that first innings, he was very assured, he went after and then hit those big sixes," Kumble said. Kumble said that Jurel's glovework has been exceptional, especially against pacers and the only way is up for the young wicketkeeper. "He has (Jurel) been exceptional, especially of the faster bowlers...He is only going to improve. This is only his second Test and I am sure as he starts playing more and more he'll only get better. And it only augers well for India. And to have him in a squad is exceptional," he elaborated.Jurel's contribution was important to the team's win in the fourth Test. In the first inning, it was his knock of 90 runs and a 76-run partnership with Kuldeep Yadav that pulled India out of a troublesome situation and reduced England's lead to just 46 runs. Later, his 39* in the second innings and partnership with Shubman Gill helped India overcome the pressure of quick wickets and pull off a tense run chase of 192 runs. He earned the 'Player of the Match' for his efforts in only his second Test.Jurel will be also in action during the fifth and final Test to be played at Dharamshala from March 7.

Title: Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba banned for four years for doping
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/juventus-midfielder-paul-pogba-banned-for-four-years-for-doping/articleshow/108117512.cms

APJuventus' Paul PogbaFrance and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba has been banned for four years for a doping offence earlier this season, Italian media reported on Thursday. Sky Sport Italy and La Repubblica reported the sports prosecutor's request for a four-year ban was granted. Pogba was provisionally suspended by Italy's national anti-doping (NADO Italia) tribunal in September after testing positive for testosterone - a banned substance. The test, performed after Juve's 3-0 Serie A season-opening victory at Udinese on Aug. 20, detected testosterone, a hormone that increases athletes' endurance. The 30-year-old was an unused substitute in that game. Pogba's positive doping test was also confirmed in a counter-analysis on a second sample in October. Juventus did not comment but a source confirmed that the club had been notified about the decision of a four-year ban and would assess the next steps. Reuters has contacted Pogba's representatives for comment.

IANSAnurag Thakur. (IANS Photo)Sports minister Anurag Thakur on Thursday announced that the government will issue digital certificates to registered athletes across the country, a move which would ensure a transparent account of their participation and performance. The digital certificate will have dates of the athletes' participation in competitions and serve as proof of their achievements.  "With athletes at the heart of our progressing and growing sporting ecosystem, the sports ministry has made a crucial decision to promote the 'issuance of digital certificates to athletes'," wrote Thakur on 'X'.  The minister had first announced his plan to simplify things for athletes and National Sports Federations (NSFs) during the National Sports Day on August 29 last year.  On the occasion, the NSF portal was launched for ensuring ease of business and good governance.  It is a unified single window for processing annual renewals and elections in NSFs.  On Thursday, the minister said, "Keeping up with our policy of 'athlete-first', National Sports Federations (NSFs) have been advocated to issue certificates to athletes via DigiLocker, an initiative of Ministry of Electronics and IT."  He said the digital certificates will add a new aspect to sports administration and management of sportspersons.  "This decision has been taken to ensure the accessibility, security and veracity of documents and promote transparency and efficiency in the sports administration of the NSFs. This will further lead to ease of living for our sportspersons across the nation.  "I request all the concerned NSFs to embrace the technological advancements and assure them of the full support needed for a smooth and timely transition," he added.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News ondigital certificatesathletesAnurag Thakurparticipationproofsports ministrygovernmentperformanceNSFsMinistry of Electronics and IT(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: WPL 2024: Puma ropes in Kareena Kapoor, Vineeta Singh to champion women’s sports
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/wpl-2024-puma-ropes-in-kareena-kapoor-vineeta-singh-to-champion-womens-sports/articleshow/108097666.cms

 Kareena Kapoor Khan and Vineeta Singh in the Puma campaignGlobal sports brand PUMA has roped in actor Kareena Kapoor Khan, entrepreneur Vineeta Singh, boxing great Mary Kom and fashion designer Masaba Gupta among key women leaders to champion the cause of women’s cricket this WPL season. The women celebrities will jointly attend a unique Ladies‘ Night at the WPL match in New Delhi on March 10 as part of the sports brand’s movement to bolster women’s cricket. PUMA, One of the world’s biggest sports brands, has taken to social media announce this association and launch a campaign with a digital film featuring these women celebrities. "Despite huge potential, women’s cricket in India is yet to achieve the desired numbers when it comes to viewership, as only 18% of the women who watch men’s cricket, watch women’s game. In the digital film, the stars pledged to not only come together to watch the WPL match between Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore at the stadium, but also welcomed women from all walks of life to join them and enjoy watching the game as a collective over this unique Ladies‘ Night," the company said in a statement. Commenting on the occasion, Karthik Balagopalan, Managing Director, PUMA India, said, “As the country’s leading sports brand, PUMA has been a long-standing driver of change in shattering gender biases and championing women’s sports. Traditionally, women in the country have not been encouraged to watch and embrace sports as men have. Now that is the need of the hour. We are at the turning point to create an equitable sporting landscape and women need to watch women’s sport in order to drive change.”Karthik added, “We are confident that this remarkable collaboration will further the narrative, level the playing field, increase fandom and create inspiration for the future generation of women athletes.”Commenting on the association, Kareena Kapoor Khan said,“ India has seen some significant performances by our female athletes recently but there is so much more scope for it to be brought out with more glory. While cricket is a religion in our country - the spotlight, the viewership, the fanfare – is markedly lesser in women’s cricket when compared to men’s cricket."  Vineeta Singh, cofounder of SUGAR Cosmetics and a judge of business reality TV show Shark Tank India, said: "Being an entrepreneur, I have faced barriers and I understand the power of breaking them. It’s disheartening to witness the vast viewership gap between men's and women's cricket, and we are committed to changing that narrative which goes beyond the boundaries of the sports arena; it's about empowering women, fostering entrepreneurship, and boosting the sports economy.” (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onWPL 2024pumakareena kapoorvineeta singhMasaba Gupta(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: Bajrang, Vinesh, retired Sakshi invited by WFI to appear for national trials
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/bajrang-vinesh-retired-sakshi-invited-by-wfi-to-appear-for-national-trials/articleshow/108020457.cms

ANIThe Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) on Monday invited protesting grapplers Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat and retired Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik to come for the national trials in March to select the team for two top Asian competitions, including the 2024 Paris Games Qualifiers in Kyrgyzstan. One of the conditions put by the United World Wrestling (UWW) while lifting the suspension on WFI earlier this month was that the three grapplers would not be discriminated against for protesting against former national federation chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.  The three have been demanding the arrest of Brij Bhushan for his alleged sexual harassment of women wrestlers. The sports ministry had also suspended the WFI last year in the wake of the serious allegations and instituted an ad-hoc panel to run the affairs of the sport.  The ministry had also ordered fresh elections, which were held in December last year, but the newly-elected body under Sanjay Singh was suspended by the ministry three days after its formation for not giving enough time to age-group wrestlers to prepare and travel before announcing the dates for the nationals.  The ministry again instituted a three-member ad-hoc panel to run the affairs of the sport.  The WFI, while announcing the trials on March 10-11, also included the names of Bajrang (65kg freestyle), Vinesh (55kg) and Sakshi (62kg), who had announced her retirement from the sport in "frustration" the day Sanjay Singh was elected president.  "I would like to inform all affiliated units of Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) that the selection trials to select the teams for participation in the following events are being conducted on 10th and 11th March 2024 at K.D. Jadhav Wrestling Indoor Stadium, IGI Sports Complex, New Delhi," said Sanjay Singh in a statement.  The trials are being held to select the teams for the Senior Asian Wrestling Championship in Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) from April 11-16 and the Asian Olympic Games Qualifier Tournament at the same venue from April 19-21, the statement added.  "All state units are requested to intimate the wrestlers as per list attached to participate in the said trials," added the statement.  The three wrestlers did not take part in the nationals organised by the suspended WFI in Pune and instead competed in the national championships conducted by the ad-hoc committee in Jaipur earlier this month.  The UWW lifting the suspension on WFI on February 13 has made things confusing in the Olympic year.  While the WFI continues to remain suspended by the ministry and the reins have been given to the ad-hoc panel, the WFI is the only body which can send teams abroad because they are recognised by the international body.  The suspension was imposed by UWW on August 23 last year after the national federation failed to hold elections in time.  Sakshi and Bajrang have also accused WFI of using devious means to get the UWW suspension lifted and threatened fresh protest.  The trials will be conducted in all the weight categories -- Olympic and non-Olympic -- in free-style and greco-roman.  Haryana's Vishal Kaliraman, who could not go to the Hangzhou Asian Games last year despite winning the trials, would be Bajrang's main opponent in the 65kg category if the Olympic medallist decides to come for the trial next month.  Several khaps had then supported Kaliraman and criticised Bajrang for going to the Asian Games despite not appearing for trials.  Antim Panghal, the only Indian to have qualified for the Paris Olympics so far, will be appearing for trials in the 54kg category.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onWrestling Federation of IndiaBajrang PuniaVinesh PhogatAsian GamesKyrgyzstanBrij Bhushan Sharan Singhsports ministrywfibajrangsakshi(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: One month before IPL, Sawai Man Singh Stadium and RCA office sealed by Rajasthan Sports Council
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/one-month-before-ipl-sawai-man-singh-stadium-and-rca-office-sealed-by-rajasthan-sports-council/articleshow/107968248.cms

ANISawai Mansingh StadiumOne month before it hosts Indian Premier League matches, the Sawai Man Singh Stadium here has been sealed by the Rajasthan Sports Council which claimed that the state cricket body did not fulfil its liabilities, including payment of dues. Rajasthan Cricket Association's (RCA) office and its academy were also sealed, along with the stadium.Rajasthan Sports Council secretary Sohan Ram Choudhary had served a notice to the RCA for handing over the property to the state council on Friday, but it did not happen.Since the handover did not happen, the state sports council went on to seal the properties owing to RCA's alleged failure of not being able to fulfil its conditions as per the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and non-payment of dues."We had sent them (RCA) numerous notices but there was no reply from their end. They only replied to increase the MoU to 10 years (from eight years). They had liabilities and they did not fulfil them," Choudhary told the media."We have sat down with RCA to find a solution. They received approximately Rs 200 crores but told us that they haven't received the sum. They had a lot of money during the Rajasthan Premier League but they did not adhere to the MoU and did not deposit the money, that's why we had to take this step," he added.Choudhary, however, gave the assurance that the venue will host the IPL matches and all other games that are slated to be organised here."This is our premise and we just took it back. The IPL matches will happen and all other national and international matches will also happen and the players will get all the facilities," he said.RCA president Vaibhav Gehlot, on his part, alleged that the move smacked of "political malice' and that his body was not given enough time to respond."The pending dues are old one, Rs 8 crore is outstanding but suddenly sealing (because of) that old case and that too before the IPL shows political malice. This should not have happened," Gehlot said."We were not given full time, the time given was less than two days, there should not be politics in sports but politics is happening which is not right," he added.Gehlot said the RCA will consult its lawyers as to what steps it would take in this matter.The Sawai Man Singh Stadium will host the local team Rajasthan Royals' opening match against Lucknow Super Giants on March 24.The second game here will be on March 28 between Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals.The IPL 2024 schedule was announced only for the first two weeks and 21 matches, owing to the general elections.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onjaipur stadium shut downSawai Man Singh StadiumIPLRajasthan Sports CouncilMemorandum of UnderstandingRajasthan Cricket Association's (RCA)rajasthan cricket association(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: Tribunal junks Rs 20 cr service tax demand on Jaypee for F1

AgenciesRepresentative image.The Allahabad bench of the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) quashed the service tax demand of ₹20.36 crore from Jaypee Sports International Limited (JSIL) in connection with the Formula One race.It said the race promotion contract between Formula One World Championship (FOWC) and JSIL was not a franchise agreement and that no service tax was leviable. "It is not possible to hold that the race promotion contract is a franchise agreement, under which FOWC provided franchise service to JSIL and consequently the demand of service tax of₹20.36 crore is clearly not sustainable," the bench of PK Choudhary, member (judicial), and Sanjiv Srivastava (technical member) said on Monday.The court said 'franchise' means an agreement by which the franchisee is granted representational right to sell or manufacture goods or to provide service or undertake any process identified with franchisor, whether or not a trade mark, service mark, trade name or logo or any such symbol, as the case may be, is involved.The court was hearing an appeal on whether the transaction between the FOWC and JSIL under the race promotion contract dated September 9, 2011, amounted to franchise service under the amended definition of franchise. -Our Bureau(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onJaypeeF1CESTATJSILJaypee Sports International LimitedAllahabad bench(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

NOIDA: Feb 22 (PTI) Sports Minister Anurag Thakur on Thursday said that over 300 sporting infrastructure projects worth Rs 3,000 crore have been established under the Khelo India umbrella.Thakur added that Khelo India and Target Olympics Podium Scheme (TOPS) had "revolutionised" the sports landscape in India.The minister, while virtually addressing students of a private university in Greater Noida, also described how the Khelo India programme annually adds 1,000 new athletes, providing them with funding for training, accommodation, diet, and a monthly allowance."Over 300 sporting infrastructure projects worth Rs 3,000 crore have been established under the Khelo India umbrella," the minister was quoted as saying in a press statement."Even the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) has transformed, providing athletes with foreign exposure, training, and world-class coaching apart from financial support to the tune of Rs 25,000-50,000 per month as out-of-pocket allowance," Thakur told students.He urged students to register for Khelo India Talent Hunt on the 'My Bharat' portal."In the realm of academia, we often underscore the importance of knowledge and intellectual pursuits. However, it's equally imperative, if not more so, to recognise the invaluable life lessons that sports impart to our youth," he said."Today, the success of sportspersons such as Deepika Kumari in archery, PV Sindhu in badminton, (para athlete) Deepa Malik, boxer Mary Kom, sprinter Dutee Chand etc... there are many names that I can take, they all have inspired so many to look at sports as a career and adopt fitness as a way of life," he added.Thakur also highlighted the Indian women's team's historic gold medal at the Badminton Asia Team Championship in Malaysia recently."They were the champions and last year (2022) we became the Thomas Cup champions. In the last 72 years, that's happened for the first time. At the World University Games in China this year, India won 26 medals. But if we look at the past, we haven't won 26 medals in total. That is how India has progressed in sports," he added.

ANIModi addresses the Khelo India University GamesPrime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized the shift in parental attitudes, noting, previously, parents hesitated to involve their children in sports activities, fearing it would distract from academics.Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports Anurag Singh Thakur inaugurated the Khelo India University games in Guwahati.

Reflecting on the values instilled through sports, Prime Minister Modi emphasized, "Success in sports requires more than just talent; it demands temperament, leadership, teamwork, and resilience." He encouraged the youth to embrace sports not only for physical fitness but also for developing essential life skills, stating, "Those who play, also flourish." Prime Minister Modi urged the athletes to explore the beauty of the North East region beyond the sports arena. He encouraged them to embark on post-event adventures, capture memories, and share their experiences on social media using the hashtag #NorthEastMemories. Additionally, he suggested learning a few local phrases to engage with the communities they visit, enhancing their cultural experience. PM Modi asked them to experiment with Bhashini App too. On the occasion Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Anurag Singh Thakur said that after the huge success of the Khelo India University Games held last year in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh and the first Khelo India Winter Games in Ladakh, it's now our turn to shine with this year’s University Games here in Guwahati. He also said that the 4th Khelo India University Games 2023 is set to be an exciting showcase for 4544 athletes from across the nation, competing in 18 different venues spread over the north-eastern states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Sikkim, Nagaland, and Tripura – our Ashtalakshmi.

Title: PV Sindhu 2.0: How a long break from sport made India's ace shuttler calmer and stronger
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/pv-sindhu-2-0-how-a-long-break-from-sport-made-indias-ace-shuttler-calmer-and-stronger/articleshow/107784302.cms

AgenciesPV Sindhu (File Pic)It was the evening before she left for Malaysia for her comeback tournament. PV Sindhu was silently confident about her return to competitive badminton having put in the hard yards all of January 2024. For any sportsperson, a comeback from injury is always the most difficult challenge of all. It is because the mind and the body aren’t in sync. For Sindhu her court coverage has always been her strength thanks to her height and build. And that’s where she wasn’t at her best. Physically she wasn’t fully there and it meant while her mind was fully focussed on court and ready to retrieve the shuttle, her body wasn’t allowing her to do so. Clearly, she was getting frustrated. The long break helped, for she needed to go back and recalibrate. Going to Prakash Padukone was a good move and a new support unit helped her get back the calm Sindhu needed as she approached the home stretch ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics.In Malaysia she has looked good. Her court coverage has been excellent and she has looked far more attacking than in her recent outings. Winning is a habit and there is little debate that Sindhu is gradually getting back into rhythm.A caveat is important here. Sindhu is still not near her best and women’s badminton royalty now involves Tai-Tzu Ying, Chen Yu Fei, An Se Young and to an extent Akane Yamaguchi. To be able to beat any one of them will involve a lot more and Sindhu is aware of the difficulties involved. But then we are speaking about the Olympics. The biggest stage of all where form and skill aren’t the only things that make a difference. The name “Olympics” is the difference and only the strong survive. That’s where Sindhu, fully fit, is special. Few know the big stage better than her and only the ignorant will want to look beyond her in the months ahead. Some have said that she made a mistake by playing the 2022 CWG with an injury. In her own words “the pain was unbearable. But then I wanted to win the gold for India. It is always a different feeling when you are playing for the flag and I had not won a CWG gold before. I had a silver and a bronze and I needed to win the gold. So there are absolutely no regrets.”If anything, the Olympics is a far bigger stage and yet again she will be playing for the tri colour. With back to back medals in Rio and Tokyo, she will be on the cusp of history as the only ever Indian woman to win three individual Olympic medals. The stakes can’t get higher and finally much like the CWG she has a silver and a bronze to her name but not the gold. Can she do the unthinkable in Paris? Again, it isn’t fair to write her off knowing her track record.Two things define Sindhu when she is playing well. First, her court coverage will be far more confident and her movement will be at its best. Second, she will be using her smashes to good effect and will use the lines to perfection. In Malaysia we have started to see glimpses of it. In the match against China and then again in the quarter final, Sindhu looked to be herself. She is leaner and has shed every little iota of the body fat that she needed to. The lethargy and the tardiness isn’t there and the confidence seems to be getting back. The fact that the pressure isn’t on her this time round will also help. If we speak of Paris and of badminton, Satwik and Chirag are the ones tipped to win a medal. World number two pair at the moment, the duo has been in red hot form all through 2023. If they stay fit, it will be a surprise if they don’t win. Prannoy too is in the reckoning. A couple of recent losses notwithstanding, on his day he has the ability to take out Victor Axelsen and much will be expected of him in Paris. Not so with Sindhu. Despite the two Olympic medals, she is much like a wild card. But then we have seen strange things happen in sport and more so when the pressure it at its highest. With the right temperament and attitude, not to mention experiFinalence, she can cause a few upsets and get closer to her dream.“Prakash Padukone will be with her at All England and that should help. The next few tournaments will tell us where she is physically and mentally. Then we can plan the final leg of the Paris preparation”, said her father, cautiously optimistic and positive. That’s what it is all about. Preparation. If Sindhu is the best prepared, results will surely come.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

Title: Hit it out of the field: From Nadella to Narayen, tech honchos pad up for 2nd season of MLC to take sport to masses in US
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/hit-it-out-of-the-field-from-nadella-to-narayen-tech-honchos-pad-up-for-2nd-season-of-mlc-to-take-sport-to-masses-in-us/articleshow/107783994.cms

Microsoft Chairman Satya Nadella , Adobe Chairman Shantanu Narayen and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma are padding up for the second season of Major League Cricket (MLC), but they won’t be sweating it out in the dugouts. Rather, they are busy expanding the sport beyond a relatively obscure corner on a foreign field where cricket is rapidly ascending the popularity ladder as Silicon Valley draws top South Asian technology talent—and, in the bargain, die-hard cricket fans that bleed blue.MLC has about 20 investors, largely of Indian origin . These include Rocketship Venture Capital cofounders Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan. Several former and current executives at Google, Dropbox and WhatsApp are also among those associated with the megabucks T20 league in the US, where cricket is still the fifth largest team sport despite more than a century of relative oblivion.As India is the nerve centre of modern cricket, its backers at home are also invested in the sport across continents. Of the six MLC teams, four are owned by those that also own clubs in the Indian Premier League (IPL). They are Chennai Super Kings (Texas Super Kings), GMR Sports (which owns Seattle Orcas along with Nadella), Kolkata Knight Riders (Los Angeles Knight Riders), and Reliance Industries-owned Mumbai Indians (MI New York). The other two teams are San Francisco Unicorns and Washington Freedom. IPL, the sport’s richest league by far, is now valued at about $15 billion, having begun in 2008 at a valuation just north of a billion dollars, as per reports by Brand Finance and American investment bank Houlihan Lokey.The idea behind MLC is to turn cricket into a mainstream sport in the US, where baseball and American football are the main team sports.“We felt there was an opportunity to develop the second most popular sport in the world (cricket) in the largest sports market in the world (US)…. MLC and its franchises are investing in building new, worldclass stadia infrastructure alongside the league, which will create an important physical footprint to evangelise the sport,” says Satyan Gajwani, vice-chairman, Times Internet. Gajwani is one of the four cofounders of American Cricket Enterprises, which promotes MLC. (Disclosure: Times Internet is a subsidiary of Bennett, Coleman & Company Ltd, which publishes The Economic Times.)MLC’s first season was held in July last year at the Grand Prairie Stadium near Dallas, Texas, and on the Church Street Park ground in Morrisville in North Carolina, generating $2.8 million in ticket sales and attracting more than 70,000 spectators. About 30% of the spectators had flown into Dallas just for the tournament.HITTING A SIXIt is a good time to grow cricket’s popularity in America, says a global spokesperson of Mumbai Indians. “Each cricket market has an opportunity, and our approach for the US is catered to strategise toward the fans and brands there, focused now on the cricket-loving audience,” says Mumbai Indians’ global spokesperson. “The objective is building a cricket ecosystem.”Mumbai Indians, owned by industrialist Mukesh Ambani, has also invested in WPL (Women’s Premier League), SA20 in South Africa and ILT20 in the UAE.A cricket aficionado, Nadella co-owns the Seattle Orcas. He led a total investment of $120 million in two tranches—$44 million in seed investment and an additional $76 million —in the league. The funds will finance the construction of cricket-specific stadia and training centres. On being asked about promoting his passion for cricket in America, and whether it will take roots in his adopted country, Nadella told ET in interview earlier this month: “Cricket was originally a big sport in the US, if history is right. And I hope it comes back.”Nadella played the game while he studied at the Hyderabad Public School. Seattle, his current home, already hosts three local cricket leagues with more than 3,500 members and is the feeder for the nascent American cricket system.“The Indian-origin population (alone) in America is approximately 5 million, which is significantly high, and the per capita income is also pretty high. They are passionate about cricket.... So, an economic power with good passion is an opportunity. And if you get to go mainstream, the opportunity gets bigger.… MLC is a new league and hence it’s a startup like IPL was around 2009-10,” says Harinarayan, who, along with his Rocketship VC partner Rajaraman, is the co-owner of San Francisco Unicorns.The franchisee also counts entrepreneurs and venture capitalists such as Sanjay Govil, founder of Infinite Computer Solutions and CEO of Zyter, and Madrona Venture Group MD S Somasegar among its investors.These investors are betting not only on the Indian American population but also on expats from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia, the UK and the Caribbean. Their aim is to build a new fan base to reach critical mass through televised games, cricket-specific stadia and training centres.THE BEDROCKFor cricket enthusiast Venu Palaparthi, MD, Patomak Global Partners, and co-chief operating officer, DASH Financial Technologies, MLC was a natural investment, having been involved in grassroots cricket development in the US since 2004. He has also founded and participated in youth cricket programmes since 2007, including the DreamCricket Academy, which co-owns the New Jersey Stallions franchise of the Minor Cricket League (MiLC).MiLC—which has 26 franchise-based, privately owned teams—is a developmental league for the MLC. Just like minor leagues for baseball, or the county cricket system in the UK, it offers competitive opportunities to young players, who can then get picked up for major league teams. “The sport needed massive investment to build the infrastructure and to bring it to the mainstream population. For cricket, the inflection point was to come in 2018, when the USA Cricket board announced it was seeking a commercial partner,” says Palaparthi.Delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, America’s first professional T20 league’s foundation was laid in 2021 with MiLC, and with MLC a year later, in 2022, to take the sport to the masses.THE INVISIBLE (TECH) HAND“Successful technology entrepreneurs have been able to dig into their pockets and write cheques in support of cricket. So, technology and social media are an invisible but strong force for the growth of cricket,” says Palaparthi.As with any franchise-based sport, the implementation phase requires additional investments. Over $1 billion (approximately Rs 8,300 crore) was put in the first year by investors, with more than $100 million spent to build cricket infrastructure in multiple cities.Most of MLC’s investors are cricket lovers. But an investment needs returns. Rocketship’s Harinarayan says: “Like any startup, we want to focus on the right metrics. We don’t want to focus on revenues on day one but on building the right product.”Palaparthi thinks of it as a generational investment. “Bringing a new sport to the market is not easy. Early stage investment like MLC or grassroots cricket is a labour of love…we are in it for the long haul,” says Palaparthi. “Having said that, once cricket enters the national sporting consciousness, the cricket GDP will grow rapidly. Already, in its first year in 2023, MLC has seen sold-out stadiums and massive viewership. So, we are on the right track.”The first season was a “big business positive”. “Now, we have to execute and build on the product the market is excited about. One good thing is top players want to play in the US as it is a desirable destination,” says Harinarayan, whose San Francisco Unicorns has partnered with Australia’s Cricket Victoria and onboarded Shane Watson as head coach.While individual teams have their sponsorships, the league also has its own sponsorships shared by owners. For MLC, the big pillars of revenue will be ticketing, corporate sponsorships, media rights and concessions—food and merchandise.CHARTING OWN COURSEMLC will ride on the success of IPL, but needs to have its own identity. Harinarayan believes that although IPL has changed cricket as a sport, MLC needs a fresh strategy as the league is being hosted in a different country with different challenges.For one, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has restricted the participation of Indian cricketers. This makes it harder for investors to popularise it in a country where cricket is beginning to reemerge. In the US, cricket was popular as a team sport between 1705 and World War I (1914-18).The US made its T20 International debut in March 2019. This year, the US will co-host the World Cup T20 with the West Indies. The International Olympic Committee has announced that T20 cricket will be played at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. Separately, the Times Group, through its North American cricket business Willow TV, is also the broadcast partner of MLC. Currently, the Times of India Group’s sport footprint is built around Cricbuzz and Willow TV. Cricbuzz is the leading global platform for cricket news, scores and alerts, in India. “In North America, Willow TV is the dominant distributor of cricket, and so, together, there is a powerful presence in that market,” says Gajwani.‘A GENERATIONAL BET’“One of the unique things about the US structure is that investors in MLC are also working to drive the growth of the sport overall, partnering with local academies, developing a minor league for emerging talent and working all the way from the grassroots up,” says Gajwani. “As the pool of local talent improves in the US, and the US National Team becomes more competitive, the overall interest in the sport will grow as well. This is a generational bet, driving interest in the sport at younger ages to develop a talent pool as they become adults.” He says the tactics needed to grow interest in a new sport are dynamic and changing.“We see both technology and social media as core parts to that strategy. We have to grow interest in a game that is unfamiliar in the US market. To do that, we will have to find disruptive ways of engaging and exciting audiences. Fortunately, things that are path-breaking spread virally today thanks to social products, and that becomes an opportunity if we are creative in our marketing and distribution to bring cricket into the homes of more American audiences,” says Gajwani.CATCH ’EM YOUNGPalaparthi believes this is a long, hard slog and it will take a concerted effort. “It has to start with schools. There are already some successful school and college programmes, where cricket is still a club sport. An increasingly large number of colleges now are playing the sport,” he says. According to him, streaming has made cricket more accessible to lean-forward fans.“In the US, there is a passion for cricket, but nothing exists that is catering to them. So, we are pouring water in a parched desert. That is the opportunity we see and is, therefore, a business case,” says Harinarayan.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onSatya NadellaShantanu NarayenIPLMLCCricketUSVijay Shekhar SharmaSilicon ValleyMukesh AmbaniIndian Premier League(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: MS Dhoni refused crores for friendship. MSD's bat sticker story revealed
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/ms-dhoni-refused-crores-for-friendship-msds-bat-sticker-story-revealed/articleshow/107696832.cms

A file photo of MS DhoniMS Dhoni, the iconic figure in Indian cricket, has sparked considerable interest with his latest bat sticker as the IPL 2024 approaches. As captain of the Chennai Super Kings, Dhoni appears to be gearing up for what could potentially be his final hurrah in cricket. Displaying the 'Prime Sports' logo on his bat serves as Dhoni's gesture of appreciation, reflecting his gratitude and affection for those who have supported him throughout his illustrious career.The owner of Prime Sports, Paramjit Singh, lauded Dhoni's action, describing it as a testament to their strong friendship. This act of appreciation transcended geographical boundaries, gaining recognition even from cricketing legends like Michael Hussey and Adam Gilchrist in Australia.Nevertheless, Prime Sports isn't the sole beneficiary of Dhoni's heartfelt gestures. Somi Kohli, the proprietor of 'Beat All Sports' (BAS), one of India's prominent sports manufacturing companies, disclosed Dhoni's greatness during the 2019 World Cup. Despite the tournament marking Dhoni's final appearance in Indian colors, he opted not to charge any fees for donning the BAS logo on his bat.— rahulmsd_91 (@rahulmsd_91) Kohli said he requested Dhoni a lot, including his parents and wife to urge him to take some money for donning BAS logo on his bat, but he told it's a tribute as I helped him in his initial days.Throughout the World Cup, Dhoni proudly showcased BAS stickers on his bat, a decision reflecting his deep-rooted bond with the brand. Kohli reminisced about Dhoni's selfless commitment, recalling how Dhoni declined any financial compensation and instead emphasized the importance of their longstanding friendship.— WorshipDhoni (@WorshipDhoni) The association between Dhoni and BAS traces back to 1998 when Kohli recognized Dhoni's potential and began supplying him with cricket kits. Despite signing deals with renowned sports brands like Reebok and Spartan, Dhoni maintained his connection with BAS, highlighting the enduring trust and camaraderie between them.Netizens praised the legend. "When you are nothing, when someone helps you, then you become something, don't forget that person, this was taught by legend Dhoni," an user said.

Title: Simona Halep's complicated CAS hearing explained. And, what is Roxadustat?
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/simona-haleps-complicated-cas-hearing-explained-and-what-is-roxadustat/articleshow/107589269.cms

ReutersSimona HalepEver since October 2022, Simona Halep has been fighting “the hardest match” of her life. Now, the former World No 1 and Wimbledon champion awaits the verdict of a three-person independent panel at the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS) in Switzerland. If Halep loses, her career will be all but over, and tennis will have its biggest doping scandal since Maria Sharapova tested positive for meldonium in 2016.Halep is appealing a four-year ban imposed by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) after testing positive for the banned substance Roxadustat at the 2022 US Open, while investigators also found irregularities in her biological passport. Halep denies wrongdoing and has blamed contaminated nutritional supplements for the findings. The charges brought before the CAS panel are serious, however.Roxadustat is used for the treatment of anaemia, but in a sporting context is prohibited because of its capacity to boost the production of red blood cells in the body. Its effect is similar to EPO, the doping product that has plagued major endurance sports such as cycling’s Tour de France.Halep, 32, has been provisionally suspended since news of her positive test for Roxadustat was announced in October 2022. She would be banned until October 2026 if she loses her appeal, by which point she would be 35. Halep says it would likely spell the end of her tennis career.“Four years is going to be a lot for my age,” she said. “Catastrophic.”Born in Constanta, Romania, Halep achieved hero status in her home country when she defeated Serena Williams to win Wimbledon in 2019. In what she would describe as the best match of her life, Halep’s stringent defence on the baseline and resilience in the rallies saw her comprehensively beat Williams 6-2 6-2, denying the American what would have been a record-equalling 24th grand slam title. For Halep, the honours that followed were fitting of her historic achievement. The first Romanian player to win Wimbledon, she showed off the trophy at the Bucharest National Stadium and later learned she would be awarded Romania’s Order of the Star the country’s top honour, as well as the distinction of being Romania’s flag-bearer at the Tokyo Olympics. Winning Wimbledon gave Halep her second grand slam title — she won the French Open the previous year — and also saw her return to World No 1. After losing her first three grand slam finals, it seemed Halep had acquired the skills required to master the sport’s biggest tournaments and was set for a dominant spell at the top of the game. Though it did not materialise: sidelined first by the pandemic in 2020 and then by a series of injuries in 2021 — which forced the Romanian to miss her Wimbledon defence that year — Halep dropped down the rankings as a new wave of champions such as Ash Barty and Iga Swiatek surpassed her to reach the top of the sport.There was also change behind the scenes. In March 2021, Halep decided to start working with a new coaching team. Halep’s breakthrough French Open title had been won with Darren Cahill in her corner, the Australian coach who has recently helped oversee Jannik Sinner’s transformation into a grand slam champion. But after parting ways with Cahill, Halep started working with Patrick Mouratoglou, previously a long-time coach of Serena Williams, and later that year moved to his Mouratoglou Academy in France.Yet as of February 2024, as Halep arrived in Switzerland for the start of her appeal at CAS, Halep and Mouratoglou were no longer working together and had not spoken in months. As witness statements to the ITIA show, before the start of the 2022 US Open, Mouratoglou and Halep’s physiotherapist Candice Gohier recommended that Halep add a collagen supplement to her nutrition plan. Halep had struggled with injuries before the US Open, having to withdraw from a warm-up tournament in Cincinnati, and Gohier ordered three new supplements. Gohier and Mouratoglou said they checked the products for banned substances and determined they were safe to use. On 29 August, after her first-round defeat at the US Open, Halep was selected for an incompetition sample. It returned a positive result for Roxadustat. Halep has been adamant that she did not take Roxadustat intentionally. In November 2023, Mouratoglou posted a video statement on his Instagram in which he took the blame on behalf of his team. “This collagen happened to be contaminated,” he said. “I feel responsible for what happened because it’s my team — so me, basically — who brought her this collagen.”Halep’s case is more complicated than a supposedly tainted supplement, however. After her positive test for Roxadustat, it emerged Halep’s biological passport — the testing system used to establish an athlete’s blood profile over several years — had recorded abnormal or “suspicious” results in the 2022 season, leading the ITIA to believe that Halep was “likely doping”. As they published their decision to hand the Romanian a four-year ban, the ITIA said its tribunal accepted Halep’s argument she had taken a contaminated supplement, but found the amounts she had ingested did not explain the concentration of Roxadustat in her urine sample provided at the US Open on 29 August 2022.Halep has maintained her innocence. A decision could be months away, and while Halep waits, her career hangs in the balance, too.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onSimona HalepCAS hearingRoxadustatdoping scandalCourt of Arbitration of Sportanaemia treatmentWimbledon championMaria SharapovaWimbledon(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: "Bumrah ripped heart out of England batting line-up": Alastair Cook

ANI"Bumrah ripped heart out of England batting line-up": Alastair CookEngland batting legend Alastair Cook lauded star Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah for his magnificent six-wicket haul in the second Test against Three Lions, saying that he changed the course of the game single-handedly and "ripped the heart out of England batting line-up".Bumrah's six-fer was the biggest highlight of the second day of the match, putting India in a great position for a series-levelling victory. The yorker that dismantled Ollie Pope's middle and leg stumps was the biggest moment of his spell. Cook noted that England started off well with openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett going at India with their attacking approach, but his wicket of Joe Root proved to be a turning point in the game. The batter said that England's first innings total of 253 is way below par.Following the match, Cook said to TNT Sports as quoted by Sky Sports, "Bumrah has carried India through today and has single-handedly changed the course of this game. England's batting card started so well with Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley, who played beautifully for 76.""His wicket, the first time he came down the wicket and tried to hit leg-side - getting a leading edge - that was the changing point. Bumrah jumped in and ripped the heart out of the England batting line-up.""Root was first to go, Pope to an unplayable in-swinging yorker, Bairstow and Stokes too falling to Bumrah. He has changed the game. He took the pitch out of it; it was down to him and him only. 253 all out is well below par," he concluded. The former England skipper noted that England let the opportunity slip to score big. He also noted that though he faced Bumrah plenty of times, he never faced him bowling at this level as he creates a different vision for the batter, which makes him unplayable."England have let an opportunity slip from 110-1, but I actually think that at some stage you have to doff your cap to the opposition. I have faced Bumrah a number of times, but I do not think I have ever faced him bowling as well as that."His awkwardness, his different angles, he creates a different vision for the batter and it makes him sometimes unplayable," he concluded.

Title: They run the world’s biggest sports, and they don’t want to leave
URL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/they-run-the-worlds-biggest-sports-and-they-dont-want-to-leave/articleshow/107390604.cms

APUEFA president Aleksander Ceferin (C) at last year’s Champions League final in Istanbul, with FIFA president Gianni Infantino (L) and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The new president of European football’s governing body settled into a chair in his glass-walled office in Switzerland, glanced out at the views of Lake Geneva and insisted he would not be there long enough to get comfortable.It was 2017, football was still emerging from its greatest scandal and Alexander Ceferin, only a few months into his presidency, was unequivocal that he was on the clock. The sport, he said, could no longer accept leaders who grew so comfortable with the trappings of power and luxury that they worked the system to remain in their jobs. He would not be like them, he promised.The three-year term to which he had been elected, finishing out the one vacated by his disgraced predecessor, “is already one term for me,” he said. If he was fortunate enough to earn the two more full four-year terms allowed by the rules, fine. But that would be it. Ceferin had no interest in being a president for life. “They said: ‘Why have term limits? You can be here for 20 or 30 years,’” he said at the time. “I do not want to stay for 20 years.”Less than a decade later, Ceferin may have had a change of heart. At his urging, the football body that he runs, UEFA, will vote next week on a set of rule changes that includes a measure that would allow Ceferin to stay in the presidency of one of the world’s richest sports organisations for years beyond the end date he once promised.He is not the only leader ushered in by someone else’s scandal now seeking to strengthen his hold on a powerful job. A similar term-limits extension was quietly approved by football’s global governing body, FIFA, ensuring that its president, Gianni Infantino, is eligible for an extra four-year term in a job that paid him about $4.5 million in cash and bonuses in 2022.At the International Olympic Committee, supporters of term-limited President Thomas Bach recently proposed that the organization’s charter be amended so that he can stay on another four years. Bach, who did not dismiss the idea, knows those rules as well as anyone: Like Infantino, he is a lawyer who helped draw up his organisation’s postscandal reforms — including the introduction of term limits — before he was elevated to the top job.Sports governance experts, though, are worried by the trend, since the current leaders were tasked with guiding their organisations out of a scandal-plagued past. They say that reforms such as term limits, born out of those scandals, are worth protecting to prevent a concentration of power into the hands of a small coterie of executives running popular and lucrative sports enjoyed by millions around the world.Weakening or eliminating them, the experts warned, is a move straight out of the playbook of world leaders and autocrats so powerful that they can choose to remain in control for as long as they wish. “It says quite simply that once people are in power, they don’t want to leave,” said Alex Phillips, a former head of governance and compliance at UEFA.Asked about Ceferin’s intentions of running again, UEFA offered no direct reply from the president, and suggested a review of his recent public comments instead. In subsequent interviews with two British outlets, which he used to settle scores with members of his administration and other rivals, Ceferin was noncommittal about whether he would seek to stay in office, despite his earlier definitive promises.But he said that unless UEFA’s current rules were revised, “there would be no limit and I could run forever.”The opposition to that possibility is growing. Interviews with UEFA executives, board members and employees over the past several months revealed that some of the most powerful figures within the organisation have objected forcefully, arguing that even a perceived weakening of term limits is unwise. One top official has resigned in protest. Another recently warned his colleagues, and Ceferin, that creating an all-powerful president went against the spirit of the overhauls enacted to avoid a repeat of past scandals.Yet when the term-limits change is voted on by UEFA’s 55 national associations at its annual meeting in Paris on Wednesday — tucked safely inside a broader package of more anodyne changes — even Ceferin’s harshest critics expect him to get what he wants.Ceferin has insisted that the proposed change is little more than a tweak of legal language, one that retains the 12-year maximum for the organization’s leaders but will now state that terms “started or served before 1 July 2017 shall not be taken into account.” Ceferin was elected in September 2016, so the revision effectively wipes away the three years he once labeled his first term, and opens the door for him to stay until at least 2031.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News oneuropean footballalexander ceferinfifauefafootball scandals(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

Title: Why do we need turning tracks, we need to play on good wickets: Sourav Ganguly

IANSFormer BCCI Chief Sourav GangulyJasprit Bumrah's throbbing afternoon spell on the second day of the second Test against England here on Saturday made former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly advocating for sporting pitches rather than preparing rank turners. Bumrah homed in on Ollie Pope's stumps with a laser-guided yorker to dismiss the England batter for 23 off 55 balls, earning it a separate fan base altogether. It wasn't entirely surprising then to see Ganguly, a lifelong supporter of pace bowling and sporting tracks, airing his views in favour of decks that keeps bowlers of all genres in the game, rather than just spinners. "When I see Bumrah, Shami, Siraj, Mukesh bowl, I wonder why do we need to prepare turning tracks in India...my conviction of playing on good wickets keeps getting stronger every game. They will get 20 wickets on any surface with Ashwin, Jadeja, Kuldeep and Axar (for support)," Ganguly wrote on his X (formerly Twitter) account. The former BCCI chief had also expressed a similar view during India's home series against Australia early last year, particularly after the Indore pitch earned "poor" rating from the ICC. "Great to see Ashwin bowl so well on a good pitch... class will always show...Hopefully, this will be a good Test match...a good opportunity for Indian batsmen after some tuff wickets to bat on, in this series," Ganguly had tweeted during the Ahmedabad Test after senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin bagged six wickets. Here too, Ganguly hinted that the overall batting quality in the longer format has dropped in the last few years because of preparing pitches with quick results in mind. "Batting quality dropping because of pitches in last 6 to 7 years at home...good wickets are a must...India will still win over 5 days," said Ganguly.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onjasprit bumrah fifergood wicketsSourav Gangulypace bowlingsporting pitchesBumrah(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 News, Budget 2024 Live Coverage, Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.
