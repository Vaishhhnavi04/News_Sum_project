"Empowering Women in Tech: Breaking Barriers, Driving Innovation",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/technology/empowering-women-in-tech-breaking-barriers-driving-innovation-884465," Hyderabad: In the fast-evolving landscape  of the technology industry, diversity stands as a cornerstone for innovation  and progress. However, despite the strides made in recent years, gender  diversity remains a persistent challenge. The need for a more inclusive tech  sector is not merely an ethical imperative but a strategic one, as diverse  perspectives foster innovation and drive business success.  Over time, the tech industry has been grappling with  gender disparities, and strides are being made to address the issue of women  being underrepresented in crucial roles and leadership positions. A current  assessment underscores an ongoing reality: women continue to be a minority in technology-related fields. The  reasons for this disparity are complex, rooted in historical biases, systemic  issues, and a lack of representation. Tackling challenges like gender  stereotypes, unconscious biases, and unintentional gender favoritism within  workplace cultures is gradually breaking down barriers for women pursuing  careers in technology. Despite persistent obstacles, efforts to bolster the  presence of women in educational pursuits and recruitment pipelines are gaining  traction, slowly dismantling the significant barriers hindering women from  entering the tech workforce. Fostering Women's Participation  in Technology To address this  gender gap, numerous programs and initiatives have emerged to encourage and  support women in pursuing careers in technology. Organizations, both within and  outside the tech industry, have established mentorship programs, scholarships,  and networking events tailored to empower and connect women in the field. Such  initiatives actively work towards bridging the gender gap in tech by providing  learning opportunities, mentorship, and a supportive community for women.  Additionally, tech companies have started implementing diversity and inclusion  policies, recognizing the importance of creating an environment that embraces  individuals from all backgrounds. Advantages of Diversity in  Driving Innovation and Business Success The business case  for gender diversity in technology is compelling. Diverse teams bring a  richness of perspectives, experiences, and ideas that drive innovation and  problem-solving. Research consistently shows that companies with diverse teams  are more likely to outperform their counterparts in terms of creativity,  productivity, and financial success.  In the tech  industry, where innovation is the lifeblood of progress, having diverse voices  at the table is crucial. Different backgrounds and experiences lead to a  broader range of ideas, enabling teams to develop more robust and inclusive  solutions that cater to a diverse user base. Moreover, diverse teams are better  equipped to anticipate and address the needs of a global market, enhancing a  company's competitiveness on a global scale. Promoting Inclusivity: Solutions  for Existing Challenges While progress has  been made, there is still work to be done to achieve true gender diversity in  the tech industry. One key solution lies in creating an inclusive and  supportive workplace culture. This involves addressing unconscious biases,  fostering mentorship programs, and encouraging women to take more risks.    Educational institutions are progressively assuming a pivotal role in shaping the future tech  workforce. There is a growing emphasis on en couraging girls to embark on STEM  (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, actively  debunking gender preconceptions, and ensuring equal opportunities for all  genders.   Promoting  inclusivity in organizations  involves transparent hiring practices based on merit and skills. This approach  emphasizes a commitment to fair evaluation and selection, ensuring that  individuals are assessed based on their qualifications, experience, and  capabilities rather than extraneous factors. By prioritizing meritocracy,  organizations not only enhance the quality of their workforce but also  contribute to a culture that values diversity and equal opportunities.  Transparent hiring fosters an environment where individuals from various  backgrounds feel empowered and valued, creating a more inclusive and dynamic  workplace. Government policies and industry  collaborations can further  amplify these efforts. Advocating for policies that promote gender equality in  the workplace and encouraging partnerships between government bodies,  educational institutions, and private enterprises can create a more holistic  approach to addressing the gender gap in tech. The imperative for  diversity in the tech industry is not just a moral stance; it is a strategic  necessity. Recognizing and embracing the unique perspectives that women bring  to the field is essential for fostering innovation, driving business success,  and ensuring that technology benefits everyone. As we continue to navigate the  challenges of gender diversity in tech, it is crucial for companies,  educational institutions, and individuals to play an active role in promoting  inclusivity. By dismantling barriers, challenging stereotypes, and fostering a  culture of equality, we can pave the way for a future where the tech industry  reflects the diversity of the world it seeks to innovate. Together, we can  build a more inclusive and vibrant tech ecosystem that unlocks the full  potential of every individual, regardless of gender.   -  Penned by Shalini Nair, Co - Founder and Board Director,  Ennoventure, Inc.

Innovative NGOs: Bridging Gaps and Elevating Lives Through Technology,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/technology/innovative-ngos-bridging-gaps-and-elevating-lives-through-technology-883405,"In the ever-evolving landscape of social  change, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) have emerged as trailblazers,  harnessing the power of innovation to bring about transformative shifts in the  lives of their beneficiaries. At the forefront of this movement is  acknowledging that innovation is not merely a luxury but a critical component  in addressing some of the world's most pressing issues.    Versatile Innovation at Work: NGOs have adopted a multifaceted approach  to problem-solving, deploying innovative methods to create solutions that  resonate. From developing low-cost technologies to strategically utilising  limited human resources, these organisations have become pioneers in maximising  impact. In the arsenal of NGOs, technology plays a  pivotal role. The development of cost-effective solutions demonstrates not only  their commitment to finding sustainable answers but also their ability to adapt  to the dynamic nature of societal challenges. These organisations have  effectively utilised technology as a catalyst for change, proving that it is  not the size of the budget but the creativity behind the solution that matters.  At Sightsavers India, one of our most significant challenges was to provide eye  health solutions to a migrant population like commercial vehicle drivers. We  did that by introducing the RAAHI – National Truckers Eye Health Programme,  under which we developed a cloud-based system that can track each beneficiary  entering our system and ensure that services are provided to them irrespective  of location.  Adapting to the Times: NGOs understand that the landscape of  poverty and marginalisation is constantly evolving. They have embraced  adaptability and resilience as core principles to address these challenges  effectively. By continually exploring new methods and strategies, NGOs not only  alleviate immediate challenges but also create a lasting impact on the lives of  their beneficiaries. Comprehensive Problem-Solving: NGOs' dedication to employing every form of  innovation showcases their comprehensive problem-solving approach. Beyond the  immediate alleviation of challenges, these organisations aim to create  sustainable, long-term change. It is this commitment that sets them apart as  catalysts for progress. The Role of AI in Bridging the Gap: However, the impact of innovation extends  beyond the conventional realms. Incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and  its adequate training for NGOs is becoming a transformative force. This  integration has the potential to bridge the gap between the profit and  not-for-profit worlds, bringing technological innovation at par for both  entities. When properly harnessed and applied, AI can  empower NGOs to enhance their efficiency in various domains. From data analysis  for informed decision-making to optimising resource allocation, AI can  revolutionise how NGOs operate. Adequate training programs can equip NGOs with  the skills needed to leverage AI effectively, thus breaking down the  traditional barriers that separate the profit and not-for-profit sectors. Bridging Technological Innovation: The synergy between AI and NGOs can elevate  those at the bottom of the pyramid. By embracing AI-driven solutions, NGOs can  streamline their processes, making their initiatives more effective and  sustainable. This, in turn, enables them to uplift the marginalised communities  they serve, bringing them up the value chain and fostering regeneration. Conclusion: As we witness the remarkable work being  done by NGOs in leveraging innovation, including the integration of AI, to  bring about positive change, it becomes evident that their endeavours go beyond  philanthropy. They are architects of progress, demonstrating how a commitment  to traditional and technological innovation can reshape the lives of those they  serve. In an ever-changing world, NGOs stand as  beacons of hope, proving that the fusion of creativity, compassion, and  cutting-edge technology can make a difference. The future holds immense promise  as NGOs continue to innovate, adapt, and embrace the potential of AI in their  mission to create a more equitable and empowered world.The article is authored by Jatin Tiwari, Director- Corporate Partnerships and Southwest Programme, Sightsavers India.

Our  communication tools for removing language barriers, such as Live Translate,  Chat Assist and Interpreter, have captured the imagination of many. People also  love Photo Assist, our tools for creativity powered by our ProVisual Engine.   Again, we’re only  getting started. While developing the Galaxy S24 series, we had many ideas and  concepts that we wanted to bring to life. Galaxy users will be able to enjoy  more Galaxy AI features that build on these ideas and concepts over time as  Samsung continuously enhances and grows the mobile AI experiences.  Moreover, we are  already planning next steps for Galaxy AI beyond smartphones – optimizing it  for various categories of devices, across various services. In the near future,  the select Galaxy wearables will use AI to enhance  digital health and unlock a whole new era of expanded intelligent health  experiences. Samsung will keep enriching and expanding Galaxy AI experiences  across categories through collaborations with more industry-leading AI  partners.   The Next Big Thing  is YOU  Over the past year,  we frequently asked ourselves what users want or need and what they could  achieve with a little assistance. These questions inspired the Galaxy S24  series, our first AI phone that invites users to imagine how their lives could  change thanks to AI. It is the phone of the future, shaping the standard of  mobile AI and defining this emerging category of AI phones.  Of course, there are  challenges and responsibilities to consider. AI models in training are still  susceptible to hallucinations, and the debate on intellectual property rights  continues. It is crucial that companies openly collaborate to carefully define  AI experiences, so users can confidently and reliably enjoy their new  abilities.  It’s also important  to raise the standards of security and privacy in this new era of  data-intensive mobile experiences. That is one of the reasons we’ve taken a  hybrid approach that combines on-device and cloud-based AI. Besides ensuring  seamless usability, this lets users limit some features to function entirely  on-device, giving them greater control over what they do with their data. We  remain committed to enhancing Galaxy device security and privacy by providing  users with transparency and choice.   In this new era of  mobile AI, it is no longer a question of what any phone can do, but what  individuals can achieve with the right tools. Galaxy S24 series provides just  some of those tools and I can’t wait to see what you will do with them. It is  you who decides what’s possible, useful, and meaningful. The next chapter of  mobile experiences does not belong to us. It belongs to you, our Samsung Galaxy  users."
THE DEEPFAKE RESURRECTION,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/technology/the-deepfake-resurrection-882709,"For the past few months, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven deepfake plague has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Several celebrities and politicians screamed foul about their deepfakes (scams and video hoaxes). However, deepfake has emerged as a tech-powered ‘Ouija Board’  [aka spirit board] breathing 'life' into ‘still’ photos of old family albums complete with graceful smiles, blinks and winks. Yaswanth Sai Palaghat, a Hyderabad based content creator and Youtuber created a Youtube video of himself using the Deep Nostalgia app to convert his childhood photo into a convincing reality. Speaking about his experience with the app, Yaswanth quips, “I was curious to explore my childhood alongside old photos of my grandfather and late relatives. I was amazed by the near accurate results bringing cherished memories to life.”  Virtual Time MachineWhile time machines still exist in La La Land, deepfake has challenged the notion of acting as a virtual time traveller in manipulating still photos to crack a smile. According to Dr. Shreeram Iyer, Group Chairman and CEO, Prisma AI, “Within virtual ancestry, deepfake breathes life into family figures and cherished moments, offering a way to reconnect with the past.” A study by The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies reveals that Deep Nostalgia, a brainchild of the My Heritage App is powered by a sophisticated deep learning algorithm from D-ID which adeptly pairs each uploaded photo with a suitable 'driver' video for convincing animations. Applica-tions like Deep Nostalgia maintain strict confidentiality of user data. Through an analysis of key features such as head orientation, the algorithm blends the photo with a compatible blueprint video, resulting in a realistic animated outcome. Real-Life ExperiencesA study conducted by Beaunoyer and Guitton 2020 reveals that the necessity to reevaluate  death and loss has become increasingly intense since the Covid-19 pandemic. Anusha Yadav, a photographer and founder of Indian Memory Project who used a deepfake webpage for one of the photographs of her late father says, “Having not seen him for 35 years, the attempt to animate his eyes and body was interesting, However, the outcome was disappointing as it was a mere machine-generated movement used for every photograph and lacked his natural essence.” Muktabh Mayank Srivastava, Co-founder of Parallel Dots tried the technology on freedom fighter Chandrashe-khar Azad. “In a world where no one has seen him in real life, we, like the algorithm, can guess. Generative AI aims for believability, not necessarily the truth.” The Ethical ImplicationsActors Rashmika Mandanna, Katrina Kaif, Alia Bhatt, and PM Modi were all victims of deepfake videos. Worse still, a 73-year-old man in Kerala lost `40 Lakh to an AI-enabled deepfake fraud. On November 8, the Indian government directed ‘social media intermediaries’ to re-move deepfake videos from their platforms within 24-36 hours of a filed complaint. However, India lacks specific regulations to penalise deepfake-generated images of ancestors or iconic figures. As regulations on the internet tighten control over deepfake content, the future appears to foster a benign outlook for the technology."
