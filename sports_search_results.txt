Page Content:Jaipur: The sporting infrastructure in Rajasthan is all set to get a major boost as Rajasthan Royals and the state government are on the cusp of signing a deal to ‘make the best sports ecosystem in the world’.“We will soon sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Royals where they will provide support in building a sports ecosystem in the coming three years,” said state sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore during the jersey launch event of the Jaipur-based Indian Premier League franchise (IPL) here on Tuesday.Royals’ chairperson Ranjit Barthakur said that they are ‘committed for the cause’. “I have often wondered why there is no proper infrastructure in Rajasthan. I feel we need to create that ecosystem where sports can thrive. I have spoken about it with the sports minister, and we will soon announce what exactly we are planning to do. We have a sportsman at the leadership position and if not him, who would look after the welfare of the players? We are making a commitment to build the best sports ecosystem in the world here in Rajasthan,” Barthakur said.Putting all speculation over Rajasthan Cricket Association’s (RCA) involvement in conducting the 17th Indian Premier League (IPL) to rest, Rathore added that it’s a three-party agreement. “Royals, Rajasthan State Sports Council and the BCCI will only conduct this year’s IPL,” he underscored.It is the first time that a state government will oversee the preparations of IPL games and Rathore wants to ensure everything is immaculately done.“Our government will leave no stone unturned to conduct the best IPL ever in Jaipur. Importantly, unlike in the past, we are committed to using Rs 5 crore that we will get from organising five IPL matches for the betterment of the players. This amount is several times more than what it used to be earlier. We have entered into many more understandings with the Royals,” the sports minister added.Out of seven, Royals will play five home games in the city. They will open their IPL campaign against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) on March 24 at the SMS Stadium.“We will also have a designated place for the sub-junior and junior players to watch the matches in the stadium, and we will also invite and give all the former state captains VIP treatment,” he further added.Sangakkara to mentor Rajasthan Ranji team: The senior state cricket team will also get an opportunity to learn from the former Sri Lanka batsman and Royals head of cricket Kumar Sangakkara. “We will also make use of the immense talent that Kumar possesses. He will be mentoring the Rajasthan Ranji team,” the Olympic medallist said.

Continuing her good run of form, the 19-year-old daughter of a rally driver from Hyderabad, secured India's 15th quota place for the Paris Games, winning gold at the Asian qualification tournament.Athletics: Jyothi Yarraji (24 years)Jyothi Yarraji's indomitable spirit can fly past any hurdle of life. India's fastest woman hurdler, who comes from a humble background, has rewritten the national record in the 100m hurdles, which stood for nearly two decades before it was broken in May 2022, thrice, and then in October 2022. She stamped her class at the international level when she claimed a silver in the 60m hurdles at the Asian Indoor championships, clocking 8.13s at Astana last year. She then rewrote history books after becoming the first Indian to breach the sub-13 second barrier by clocking 12.79s at National Games last year. At the Hangzhou Asian Games, she won a silver in the 100m hurdles. Earlier this year, she bettered her own national record by sprinting 8.12s in the 60m hurdles to secure a gold at the Asian Indoor Championships which was held in Tehran.Athletics: Shaili Singh (20 Years)Shaili Singh is being considered as the rightful successor to the legendary Anju Bobby George. The Jakarta Asian Games gold medal winner, who had jumped 6.55m to stand on top of the podium, is currently ranked as the top long jumper in Asia. The 20-year-old came remarkably close to breaking her mentor Anju's long-standing national record of 6.83m, with a jump of 6.76m at the India Grand Prix in Bengaluru last year. Raised by a single parent, mother Vinita Singh, in Uttar Pradesh's Jhansi, Shaili started running barefoot and "would often return home with blisters on her feet. "My mother would weep at the sight," Shaili once recalled. She burst into the limelight after winning silver (6.59m) at the Under-20 World athletics championships in 2021 before securing her first senior international medal when she claimed another second-place finish at the Asian meet in 2023.Badminton: Anmol Kharb (17 years)Anmol Kharb has emerged as the big hope for Indian women's badminton. Her sensational performance in India's historic gold medal winning run at the Badminton Asia Team Championships has provided the shuttle fans belief that she can follow in the footsteps of Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu. Had it not been for Anmol's powerful strokeplay, technical skill and mental fortitude, India wouldn't have been able to clinch its maiden gold in Shah Alam. The 17-year-old from Haryana's Faridabad played three matches in the Asian meet and won all of them, defeating more experienced and higher ranked opponents. But what made the success sweeter was the fact that all her wins came in the decider, including the final. Anmol was always meant to achieve bigger things, becoming the India No. 1 in both the under-17 and 19 age groups. She became the women's singles national champion at the age of 16. Last year, she was selected to be a part of the senior team for the Asian championships.Golf: Avani Prashanth (17 years)Ever since golf returned to the Olympic fold, rubbing shoulders with the best and competing at the biggest sporting extravaganza has been teen wonder Avani Prashanth's dream. The 17-year-old golfing sensation has made rapid strides in her quest to get there with a clutch of impressive performances in the last couple of years. With the Olympics in her sights, the Bengaluru-based teenager, who made the Indian team for the Hangzhou Asian Games, has dominated the amateur circuit in the country. She went on to win the Queen Sirikit Cup in Manila early in the year the only Indian to do so in its 43-year history. Avani now feels she is ready for the Olympics.

Page Content:JAIPUR: Eventually the inevitable happened on Friday as Rajasthan State Sports Council (RSSC) sealed the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) office and its academy along with Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Stadium cricket ground. The RSSC secretary Sohan Ram Choudhary had sent a notice to the RCA on Friday (February 23) to handover the aforementioned property to the council, but when it did not happen, the former sealed the entire space.The state cricket association had earlier this month sent a letter to the RSSC with regard to the renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), but the latter did not take the matter forward.Under the MoU, the state cricket association gets the permission to use the SMS cricket ground along with the North and South Blocks which belong to RSSC. Its five-year term ended on Wednesday (February 21).It has been learnt that the RSSC secretary had sent a letter to the RCA officials on February 19 in which he mentioned about the cricket body failing to honour the MoU conditions and not making the payment on several occasions. The letter also mentions that RCA is under a debt of Rs5 crore. Purportedly this became the reason for the sports council to not renew the MoU.Since there was no communication from the RCA on this front, registrar Archana Singh appointed additional registrar (processing) Jitendra Prasad Sharma to investigate the matter."The investigation will be carried out on February 29 and all the involved parties are requested to submit their replies in writing…," read the letter by Sharma which was sent to the RSSC secretary along with RCA secretary Bhawani Shankar Samota, president Vaibhav Gehlot, vice-president Shakti Singh Rathore and treasurer Rampal Sharma on February 22.RCA president Vaibhav said that the sports council should have given some time to handover the property to them. "They pasted the notice without giving us sufficient time. Usually there is a seven or a 15-day period that is given to any party before they can handover the premises, but they did not even consider that," he said.

Page Content:NEW DELHI: Double Paralympics gold medallist, Devendra Jhajharia, has decided to contest the Paralympic Committee of India’s (PCI) elections for the president’s post, setting the stage for another celebrated sportsperson to helm an Indian sports federation.The PCI is currently under suspension by the sports ministry for its failure to hold elections on time.The ministry had called the delay as “willful and intentional’, which went against the principles of the national sports code resulting in non-compliance with guidelines.Javelin thrower Jhajharia, who won the gold at the 2004 Athens and 2016 Rio Paralympic Games in the F46 disability category, filed his nomination papers for the top job on Wednesday here, representing his home state of Rajasthan. Thursday is the last date to file the nomination papers for the PCI elections scheduled on March 9 at the India Habitat Centre and Jhajharia so far is the lone candidate to run for the presidential post.The office bearers and governing board members will be elected for a period of fours years from 2024 to 2028 for the posts of president (1), vice presidents (2), secretary general (1), treasurer (1), joint secretaries (2) and executive committee members (5).TOI has learnt that current PCI chief Deepa Malik – the country’s first female para athlete to win a medal at the Paralympics in Rio 2016 – has received nomination from the Bihar state association but the Haryana-born sports administrator hasn’t filed her nomination yet.It would be interesting to see if Malik throws her hat into the ring with Thursday being the last date to file nominations. Sources claimed that Malik has the govt’s backing but has been persuaded by some office bearers of the PCI to drop out of the race and extend her support to Jhajharia.“Jhajharia is all set to become the president of the PCI. He filed his nomination papers only after he got the assurance from PCI voters that he would be elected to the top post. He is very keen on contesting the elections after serving the last four years in the PCI’s governing board as the athlete council representative,” a source informed.It’s been learnt that the no office bearer from the outgoing executive body will contest the upcoming elections, bringing an end to the tenure of PCI’s long-serving secretary general Gursharan Singh. “An entirely new executive committee will take charge, headed by Jhajharia,” another source said.The 42-year-old Jhajharia won silver at the Tokyo Paralympics in 2021, apart from winning a gold in 2013 and a silver in 2015 (both F46 category) at the Para World Championships.“With encouragement from my well-wishers and with an aim to work for the betterment of para sports and para athletes, I have filed my nomination papers for the post of president of PCI. I have been a representative of para athletes in the PCI for the last four years, but many well-wishers wanted me to lead the PCI now, so I am here as a candidate for the top post. At the Tokyo Paralympics, we won an impressive 19 medals. This time in Paris, our endeavour is to win more medals,” he said.

Title:Role of good nutrition in enhancing sporting performance in women

Page Content:We are now entering a new era, one that could be best described as " targeted nutritional periodization". The field of sports nutrition continues to grow at a rapid rate. Nutrition plays a crucial role in enhancing sporting performance. It is a major factor behind peak athletic performance, and women athletes are no exception. Consuming the right amount of calories is essential for maintaining energy balance and fueling physical activity.It is clear that carbohydrate remains the king and that carefully chosen ergogenic aids (e.g., Caffeine, Sodium, Bicarbonate) can all promote performance in the correct exercise setting. Role of good nutrition - Macronutrients and micronutrientsCarbohydrates, protein, and fats are the three macronutrients that play a key role in fuelling physical activity and supporting muscle recovery. Balance intake of macronutrients is important for optimal sporting performance. Carbohydrates are particularly important as they are the primary source of energy for high-intensity exercise and help athletes maintain energy balance and optimize performance. Protein contributes to muscle repair and growth, making it essential to support training demands.Good nutrition is not only about macronutrients but also about micronutrients. Consuming a variety of fruits, vegetables whole grains and lean protein which are rich in essential vitamins and minerals can ensure adequate intake of essential micronutrients that help enhance the sporting performance of women athletes. Micronutrients such as vitamin D, calcium, iron, and magnesium help bone health, immune system, and energy metabolism. Women involved in sports should also drink an adequate amount of water to prevent themselves from dehydration-related complications during and after sporting events like marathons and exercise regimens.Eating the right food at the right time can help optimize performance and recovery. A balanced diet or a snack that contains carbohydrates and protein before and after exercise helps to support muscle recovery. Emerging evidence also indicates Vitamin D to be associated with muscle regeneration. Based on recent research, the consumption of dark chocolate has been reported to have multiple health benefits in humans. Cold Weather Concerns: Understanding and Managing Your Child's AsthmaEvery woman is unique, and their nutritional need may vary based on various factors such as age, weight, activity level, and sport. Thus, working with a registered dietitian or sports nutritionist helps them develop individualized nutrition plans that can support their specific goals and performance needs.In conclusion, proper nutrition is essential for enhancing sporting performance in women athletes. By fueling the body with a balanced diet and good hydration, women can optimize their performance, recovery, and overall health.(Author: Dr. Tasneem Nishah Shah, Consultant and Clinical Lead, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Manipal Hospital Whitefield)
